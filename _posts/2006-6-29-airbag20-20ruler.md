nice trick, I have done something simular, but not as nicely styled...

<img width="128" height="8" id="image154" alt="ruler" src="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ruler.thumbnail.gif" />

Set this image in the background to quickly determine the actual width of your element. Not quite as accurate as taking screenshots and measuring them in Photoshop, but quicker...
