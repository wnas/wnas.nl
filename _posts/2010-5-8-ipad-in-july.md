As a developer I want to have one as soon as possible of-course, so I can test my stuff on it.</p>
<p>The big question now is, should I get one in june in the UK when I'm there for<a href="http://atmedia.webdirections.org/"> Web Directions @media</a>, or should I wait a full month. <em>Available in july will probably mean the end of july... </em></p>
<p>And in case you have been hiding under a rock, here is the keynote <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/specialevent0110/">announcing</a> the iPad.</p>
