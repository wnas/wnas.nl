<p>After getting the news that IE8 would embrace the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">standards</a>, I anxiously <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm">downloaded</a> IE8 beta last night to give it a first look. I have to say, I am impressed.</p>
<p>No it will not be me main browser, as it is does not run on os x without parrallel's and I have several browsers, for several tasks. Firefox 2 and 3 for developement and camino for browsing. But as IE is still the biggest browser on the market, I have to test with it. And to my surprise, life just got easier.</p>
<p>At first I just saw IE7 with a big button to emulate IE7.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2314342738" title="View 'emulate7.png' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2160/2314342738_2e00a97510.jpg" alt="emulate7.png" /></a><br /> Clicking on it resulted in a question, microsoft style...</p>

The warm and fuzzy feeling I allways get from microsoft products really got me fast this time and I <em>almost</em> decided to quit for the night.<strong>But</strong> I decided to look a little bit further and saw a new option under 'Tools' called <em>Developer Tools</em>.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2312382027" title="View 'developertools.png' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2312382027_56d07a6457.jpg" alt="developertools.png" border="0" width="243" height="276" /></a> With me being a developer and all, I decided to check it out and what did I see. A (imho) crappy dom inspector and such but with one thing that made me day. <br /><strong>The ability do change rendering modes without restarting..</strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2313192040" title="View 'switchingIE8to7to5.png' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2313192040_1a6a0b587a.jpg" alt="switchingIE8to7to5.png" border="0" width="500" height="194" /></a></p><p>This is a <strong>great</strong> feature, as it eliminates the need for a couple of browsers on me system. I am sure that the rest of IE's improvements are great, js and css stuff, a few new features I am not interested in, this is the thing for me.</p><p>So go and download ie8, it <strong>will replace</strong> ie7, but as it emulates it that doesn't matter and have fun.</p>
