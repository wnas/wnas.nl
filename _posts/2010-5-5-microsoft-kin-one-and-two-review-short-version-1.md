<p>Here are some random lines I decided to be the most striking ones.</p>
<ul><li>Overall, it's just a deeply, deeply frustrating and inconsistent experience.</li><li>.. and the phone only updates every 15 non-user-adjustable minutes. Sometimes less!</li><li>No app store, no IM client, no games, no calendar... not even visual voicemail or some carrier-hitched GPS app. </li><li>While using the One and Two we found ourselves consistently confused or surprised by how many bad little interface problems there</li><li>We'll chalk the better performance up to that heavily controlled sync schedule (once every 15 minutes at the most).</li><li>If you're going to shell out this kind of money each month, it would be foolish to even consider these devices given the much, much better options out there.</li><li>In the end, we're left with two orphan devices </li><li>On the One, it's usually good for taking a picture after a firm press, but sometimes there's no reaction at all, while on the Two, it tends to focus in and out and then never snap a photo. </li></ul><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/05/kin-one-and-two-review/1">Microsoft Kin One and Two review -- Engadget</a>: ""</p>
