I have been seeing this quote, in one form or another on forums for some years. Decided to post it here, so I will not forget, being an former graphic designer turned User Interface Designer/developer....

"Anyone can create a usable website. It takes a graphic designer to make it slow, confusing, and painful to use."

so very, very true.
It also works for developers, who think about code, not users...
