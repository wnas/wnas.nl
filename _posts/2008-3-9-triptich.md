After 3 years in the shed in my garden, I finally gave this nice little trio a good spot. These gold brothers now decorate the hall. What's interesting is that a full three years of being kept in a cold and damp place hasn't affected them a bit. Makes you wonder about all the worries people have about painting in museum's. When I made these paintings I was smoking sigarettes, something a lot of my fellow students did, some of that work now hangs in museums where it is treated with more care, than ever intended by the artist...
</p><p>These three paintings are part of a series of everyday objects I painted in 1994 - 1996. They represent a hinge and a glove.</p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2321031410" title="View 'IMG_1015.JPG' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2321031410_735d298cd3_t.jpg" alt="IMG_1015.JPG" border="0" width="67" height="100" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2321031480" title="View 'IMG_1016.JPG' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/2321031480_ace15f2de9_t.jpg" alt="IMG_1016.JPG" border="0" width="67" height="100" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2320218529" title="View 'IMG_1017.JPG' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2320218529_661d5e66fd_t.jpg" alt="IMG_1017.JPG" border="0" width="67" height="100" /></a>
