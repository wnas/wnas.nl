<blockquote>I'm in the process of founding a Dutch Guild of Front-End programmers. This entry is a national call to action
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/07/gilde_van_front.html"><cite>Peter-Paul Koch</cite></a></blockquote><!--more--><p>Peter-Paul Koch has started a great thing. A guild for front enders in the netherlands, a way to try and put us on the map as a real discipline.</p>
<p>After years of working in the field as a professional front-ender, he got tired of telling people that it is a real job. Not just something that you can do on the side, something that I have been saying (together with a lot of people) for years. Up to this day, front end is often done by the graphic designer or java developer. The guild is a try to put our job on the map.</p><p>We already have over 50 members and are growing fast, now that we agreed to 'come out'. You can read the (dutch) announcement <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/07/gilde_van_front.html">here</a>, or you can sign up for the <a href="mailto:frontendgilde-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">annoucement list</a>.
At the official page you can read about what we have done (I only went to the last meeting at <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomgreuter/sets/72157600546024410/" title="see tom's foto's">info.nl</a>) and what we are going to do and talk about.</p><p>Last but not least, it is a great way to set the dutch <a href="http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/"><em>webrichtlijnen</em></a> on the map.</p>
Tell me what your opinion of this news is...
And to no suprise, I counted a couple of happycloggers at that meeting...
