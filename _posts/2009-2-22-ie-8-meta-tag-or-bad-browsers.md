<p>After reading that one of my biggest customers is on the <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=2072">Microsoftâ€™s IE 8 incompatibility list</a>, I decided that we will add this to the next release of the website...</p><pre><code>&#60;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8" /&#62;</code></pre><p>IE 8 will then render the page within some form of IE8 compliant mode. Although I do <strong>not</strong> support the decision that the IE team made, I decided that my users don't need to suffer from my frustrations. So I go with the flow, not against it. We will still support <abbr title="worst nightmare for a web developer">IE 6</abbr> and even 5 for that matter, no matter how I feel about it. After all it is still about the <strong>user</strong>, not about the developer.</p><p>So the whole discussion (<a href="http://fronteers.nl/blog/2009/02/wordt-noorwegen-ons-voorbeeld">fronteers</a>, <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/02/to_hell_with_ba.html">quirksmode</a>) wether or not we should give IE (insert version here) the boot, is irrelevant from my point of view. A browser is a way the user can see the content we serve and it is not up to <span title="webdevelopers">us</span> to decide what he/she uses to see it. Sure, we can build stuff way easier by excluding bad browsers, but if you can't support ie6 as a web developer....</p><p>I say, let's not worry about bad browsers and just use progressive enhancement to give better browser a better experience. IE 6 (or what ever version) will die out eventually. We know how to deal with it's quirks now, after all it has been almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">8 years</a>, so stop whining and go on.</p><p><em>And yes, I have said <a href=" http://wnas.nl/internet-explorer-8-defaults-to-standards-mode">something</a> about it earlier, in case you wondered.</em></p>
