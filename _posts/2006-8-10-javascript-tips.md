A movement is going on to better the name of javascript in the world. Those of you who have been around long enough know of the bad rep javascript got during the<strong> Dhtml</strong> era, this is changing.

A good number of javascript articles are being written nowadays. So much the better as most of the scripts you find are still old skool. If you search a little harder, you are now more likely to find stuff about 'unobtrusive' javascript. I will give you a number of articles (and sites) with stuff that will help you along.<!--more--><a title="The importance of maintainable javascript (vitamin)" href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/dev/the-importance-of-maintainable-javascript">the importance of maintainable javascript</a>
