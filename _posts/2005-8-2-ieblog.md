Things that are supposed to be fixed in ie 7 include:

# Peekaboo bug
# Guillotine bug
# Duplicate Character bug
# Border Chaos
# No Scroll bug
# 3 Pixel Text Jog
# Magic Creeping Text bug
# Bottom Margin bug on Hover
# Losing the ability to highlight text under the top border
# IE/Win Line-height bug
# Double Float Margin Bug
# Quirky Percentages in IE
# Duplicate indent
# Moving viewport scrollbar outside HTML borders
# 1 px border style
# Disappearing List-background
# Fix width:auto

If it all is included in the final version, ie 7 will be a blessing to us ( web developing grunts )...
