The <a href="http://fronteers.nl/vereniging/commissies/diplomering">commissie Diplomering</a> of the dutch fronteers has been busy. We have met a number of times and came up with a plan how to determine the knowledge level of a front end developer. Before we are going to start, we have to gather as much questions as possible.</p>
<p>One of the things that we are going to test is the knowledge of the <a href="http://w3.org">specs</a>. In order to do that properly, we need your help...</p>

<p>As we all know there a multiple solutions to each problem, what we need are questions that we can test. Something that you can look up in the specs.</p>
<p>So please add a question in the comment here or on the (dutch) <a href="http://icanhaz.com/cssvragen">fronteers site</a>.<br />
If you have any questions, you can <a href="http://wnas.nl/index.php/contact">contact</a> me or, talk to me at the next <a href="http://fronteers.nl/blog/2008/01/fronteers-bijeenkomst-8-januari-amsterdam">fronteers meeting</a>.
