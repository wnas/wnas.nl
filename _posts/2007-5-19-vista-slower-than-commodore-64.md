To bad that I sold my commodore 64 a couple of years ago (in 1986). But still this is funny, see <a href="http://www.techworld.nl/article/3366/vista-trager-dan-commodore-64.html">this</a> article on techworld...
Am I glad that my macs (a powerbook g4 and a macbook pro c2d 17") only get faster with each update, I can't wait to get leopard. That will give me another speed boost, if it is the same as when I went from panther to tiger...
