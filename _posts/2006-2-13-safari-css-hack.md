<strike>a new trick up my sleeve
<a title="safari hack" href="http://www.jasonkarldavis.com/articles/notmychild/">not my child hack for safari</a></strike>

Posted too fast, haven't got it working, still, If you know any safari hacks, please let me know...

One I have found to work is:
<pre>type="text/FOO"</pre>
instead of :
<pre>type="text/css"</pre>
Change this in your css import link, as to import a safari only css file (works in safari 1.3 os x panther )

<em>EDITED
take a look at <a href="http://www.wnas.nl/?p=212" title="hack">this</a> one...

A list for more hacks can be found here  <a title="css filters (dithered.com)" href="http://www.dithered.com/css_filters/index.html">CSS filters</a></em>
