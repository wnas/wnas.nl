<a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/reference/templates/xhtml10t/">Conforming XHTML 1.0 Transitional Template - The Web Standards Project </a> something very usefull in everyday life.
I have snippets like this in myEclipse standing ready, but if you haven't start your collection, start with this one.

Great as a starting point, you need to have a steady base to build on after all. Mine was adobe pagemill, remember that one, if you do, you are old skool :)...
