<p class="hcard"><a class="fn url" href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clark</a> the much recognized author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transcending-CSS-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321410971/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1197830644&sr=8-1" title="book">Trancending CSS</a> and invited expert for the css working <a href="http://w3.org/">group</a> started a discussion last week.</p><p>He proposed to <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/css_unworking_group/">disband</a> the css working group. This week he explains more about his <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/">action</a>. I am curious about where this is going...</p>
<p>In my opinion he has got a point, it sure is ridiculous that something like css 2.1 is being held back by browser vendors. The same browser vendor that gave us 6 years of the same browser, after they won the war...</p>
<p>He finishes with a clear proposal about what should be done, a simple plan and revolutionary... Let's treat it like a product...<br /><a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/">Go andy go...</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, other people voice their opinion...</p>
