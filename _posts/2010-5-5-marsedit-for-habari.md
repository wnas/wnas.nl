<!--p><strong>5-5-2010</strong></p-->
<p>After a few years on Habari, I stumbled upon Marsedit again. And with the help of one <a href="http://www.habariproject.org/dist/plugins/metaweblog/">plugin</a> I got it working. So now I am off to see it is as good for Habari as it was on Wordpress.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-right: -50px;" title="MarsEdit3Icon128.png" src="http://wnas.nl/user/files/marsedit3icon128_20100505094655.png" border="0" alt="Marsedit" width="128" height="128" /></p>
<p>So what's new in version 3.0?</p>
<h3>All new Rich Text Editor: No HTML Required</h3>
<p>The rich editor offers an alternative to MarsEdit's beloved HTML text editor. While you are writing your blog posts you can style text, arrange images, create lists and more without using HTML code.ï»¿</p>
<p><strong>I am not so sure if I like this, as I love my HTML...</strong></p>
<h3>Updated HTML Editor with Advanced Syntax Highlighting</h3>
<p>For those who prefer straight HTML we've added beautiful new syntax highlighting with different colors for attributes, keywords and tag structure, to make it easy to spot syntax errors at a glance.</p>
<h3>Support for WordPress Pages</h3>
<p>MarsEdit now lets you download, edit, and create Page entries on WordPress blogs. Now you can manage your blog and your permanent site pages from the same comfortable interface.</p>
<p><strong>This I don't need for now, but am sure to find useful in future projects...</strong></p>
<h3>Support for Custom Fields</h3>
<p>For WordPress and other blogs that implement the WordPress API, you can configure custom fields in MarsEdit to customize the post editing interface.</p>
<h3>iPhoto, Aperture and Lightroom Integration.</h3>
<p>Browse your media collections to find the perfect photo for your post. When you attach an image, MarsEdit lets you specify the size, name, and alternative text in one easy step.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Media Attachments</h3>
<p>With scheduled media attachments you can compose your posts with rich media even when completely offline. When you are ready to publish, the images or other media files are uploaded to your blog and inserted into the post.</p>
