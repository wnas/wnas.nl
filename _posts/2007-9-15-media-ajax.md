PPK has gotten me interested in <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">this</a> and it is looking better everytime more info is getting available. Maybe I will go, two @media's a year is better than one, don't you think?

<strong>Update</strong>
I am going, just booked. Pretty exciting, this is my first time going to a major conference as a independent contractor. That means, booking flights, hotels and stuff. If any other dutch people are going, please let me know... Happy clog or front end gilde meeting in london, I'm in...
