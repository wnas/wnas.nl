I am not all for blogs being used as link dumps, but this one I will not withold from you. How to really use multiple IE versions. As I have noticed (and you too, if you have really tested) the conditional comments don't work correctly.

A co-worker pointed me to a great <a title="position is everything, taming ie" href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/multiIE.html">article</a> which tells you how to fix this problem

Go on, try it out and let me know if it helped you (or if this is old news...).
