I think they are right, flash has it's place. But it's usage for video for example is an excellent example of what you should use HTML5 for nowadays.</p>
<blockquote><p>"But flash as a video container makes very little sense for CPU, WiFi battery usage etcetera – you can cook an egg on [devices] once you start running Flash on them and there's a reason for that."</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't get me wrong, flash is great for some <a href="http://demonsters.nl/" title="Friends of mine who are doing amazing stuff with flash">stuff</a>, but I even see it for building webforms ( with openLazlo ) and that is just plain <strong>stupid</strong>.</p><p>The best line I think was:</p>
<blockquote><p>"But at Opera we say that the future of the web is open web standards and Flash is not an open web standards technology"</p></blockquote>
