                "content": "<p>The past few weeks I had a lot of fun playing with <a href=\"http:\/\/ui.jquery.com\">jQuery UI<\/a> for a client. They wanted to replace some elements in an application, sliders and such, with a more accessible solution. For that I turned to jQuery UI, as I had previously introduced <a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\">jQuery<\/a> as the standard javascript library for them.<\/p><p>As I started to play with the code I couldn't helped but be impressed by the great work that has been done by the UI <a href=\"http:\/\/ui.jquery.com\/about\">team<\/a> on this project. But as I looked at it more closely I found some things that could be improved.<\/p>\r\n<p>So here are some of my grieves with it and a possible way to solve them. I am going to concentrate on the slider ( <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.jquery.com\/UI\/Slider\">docs<\/a> \/ <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.jquery.com\/view\/tags\/ui\/1.5b2\/demos\/ui.slider.html\">demo<\/a> ), as it was with that widget that I started to notice some things missing.<\/p><p>The way you use it is in a true jquery fashion nice and unobtrusive, once you have included the correct javascript files (for that see the documentation), you just do:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>$(\"#slider\").slider();<\/code><\/pre><p>And shazaam, <code>#slider<\/code> has turned into a slider, nice... But, what happens to the input that people provide...<\/p><p>This solution is nothing without javascript, so in my book it is a nono. I can not imagine that I could use this widget on my sony erikkson k800 phone. So accessible it is not, at least not in the way the demo shows us. And as most people will just copy and paste from demo's, most sliders will not be accessible.<\/p><p>So what you say, a slider can never be accessible, rubbish I say. Stick with me and I will show you a very simple way to make this accessible. <em>And in a few day I will put up some example sliders to accompany the code as suggested by <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/danny_l\">Danny Lagrouw.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Improvement<\/h3><p>First we will look at what a slider does, it provides a user the possibility to enter data. Whoa, a whole new concept... eh <strong>no<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Lets start with an simple <code>&#60; input type=\"text\" \/&#62;<\/code> that gives people a good opportunity to enter a value, no? But what about <a href=\"#steps\">stepping<\/a> you say, that we can solve with a few <code>&#60; input type=\"radio\" \/&#62;<\/code>. All we have to do is write javascript that sends the value of the slider to the input and when the form is submitted, the server can sort it out.<\/p><p>If a user has no javascript a viable alternative is provided. So not only advantages on the user level, but did you notice that we just solved the data to server problem, in a way that requires us to write <strong>zero<\/strong> I admit it is boring but if you want your fancy interface to do something, it has to interface with the back-end as well.<\/p><p>So we start with the html, as that is the base for accessible solutions, we set up a free form slider. As we do this, we make sure that we create a fully functional option for everybody. That is, the purpose of the slider is to set a value.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>&#60;div class=\"slider free\" id=\"slider\"&#62;\r\n  &#60;label for=\"text\"&#62;\r\n    label\r\n  &#60;\/label&#62;\r\n  &#60;input type=\"text\" id=\"text\" \/&#62;\r\n&#60;\/div&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>As you see a nice and clean solution where data can be entered and processed. What we miss is the fancy slider, which we will create with javascript like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\/\/ add a slider container div\r\n\/\/ add a slider handle to slider container\r\n\/\/ place a span to recieve the value\r\n\/\/ and add a class to the container\r\n\/\/ find and set the input to readonly\r\njQuery('.slider')\r\n  .append('&#60;div class=\"slideContainer\"&#62; \/\/ br\r\n      &#60;div class=\"ui-slider-handle\"\"&#62; \/\/ br\r\n      &#60;\/div&#62; \/\/ br\r\n    &#60;\/div&#62; \/\/ br\r\n    &#60;span class=\"value\"&#62;&#60;\/span&#62;') \/\/br\r\n  .addClass('sliding') \/\/ br\r\n  .find('input').attr(\"readonly\",\"readonly\");\r\n\/\/ linebreaks (br) added for readability<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>There you have it, an <strong>accessible<\/strong> solution for a slider, simple as that.<\/p><p>But wait, what if I have 5 steps that I want people to choose from. That I cannot do, so your solution sucks and I still am stuck with a pure javascript solution says the sceptic (I know who you are...). Oke, the second one is a slider with steps for you.<\/p><p>First let us see what that is, it is simply a option you choose from a limited number of options isn't it. The html solution for this is really easy, <strong>radio buttons<\/strong>. So of we go with html<\/p>\r\n<pre id=\"steps\"><code>\r\n&#60;div class=\"slider steps\" id=\"slider2\"&#62;\r\n &#60;fieldset class=\"radios\"&#62;\r\n   &#60;legend&#62;legend&#60;\/legend&#62;\r\n   &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"radio\" value=\"0\" id=\"v0\" \/&#62;\r\n   &#60;label for=\"v0\"&#62;zero&#60;\/label&#62;\r\n   &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"radio\" value=\"1\" id=\"v1\" \/&#62;\r\n   &#60;label for=\"v1\"&#62;one&#60;\/label&#62;\r\n   &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"radio\" value=\"2\" id=\"v2\" \/&#62;\r\n   &#60;label for=\"v2\"&#62;two&#60;\/label&#62;\r\n   &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"radio\" value=\"3\" id=\"v3\" \/&#62;\r\n   &#60;label for=\"v3\"&#62;three&#60;\/label&#62;\r\n   &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"radio\" value=\"4\" id=\"v4\" \/&#62;\r\n   &#60;label for=\"v4\"&#62;four&#60;\/label&#62;\r\n &#60;\/fieldset&#62;\r\n&#60;\/div&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>Just like that we have a viable and accessible solution in plain old semantic html, now for the javascript.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>var sliderSteps = {\r\n radiobuttons : ((jQuery(this) \/\/br\r\n   .find('input[type=\"radio\"]') \/\/br\r\n   .length)-1) \/\/br\r\n   .toFixed(0),\r\n   init : function(targ){\r\n     sliderSteps.createSlider(targ);\r\n     sliderSteps.set(targ)\r\n   },\r\n   set : function(targ){\r\n     var w = (100\/((sliderSteps.radiobuttons*1)+1));\r\n     jQuery(targ) \/\/br\r\n       .find('label, .ui-slider-handle') \/\/br\r\n       .width(w+'%');\r\n     },\r\n     createSlider : function(targ){\r\n     jQuery(targ).slider({\r\n       \/\/ zoveel stappen als er radio button zijn...\r\n       steps : sliderSteps.radiobuttons,\r\n       change:function(e,ui){\r\n         var x = jQuery(this).slider('value');\r\n         var a = (x\/100*((jQuery(this). \/\/br\r\n          find('input[type=\"radio\"]').\/\/br\r\n          length)-1)).toFixed(0);\r\n         \/\/ set the value somewhere...\r\n         jQuery(this).find('.value').text(a);\r\n         \/\/ check the radiobutton.\r\n         var t = jQuery(this). \/\/br\r\n          find('input[@type=\"radio\"]')[a];\r\n         jQuery(t).attr('checked','true');\r\n       }}\r\n     );\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n sliderSteps.init('#slider2.steps');\r\n\/\/ linebreaks (br) added for readability\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>So there you have it, a nice clean and <strong>accessible<\/strong> slider solution for the folks at jquery ui to include in their demos. And for everybody else to look at and maybe even use. So have fun with it and let me know if you like it.<\/p><p><em>If you see any faults in the code please let me know, but as I am on holiday now, don't except me to rush...<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Here is all the demo code zip file <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/files\/jquery-ui-slider\/wnslider.zip\" title=\"wn.slider.zip\">wn.slider.zip<\/a> for you to play with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\r\n<p>Technorati Tags:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/ajax\" rel=\"tag\">ajax<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/javascript\" rel=\"tag\">javascript<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/jquery\" rel=\"tag\">jquery<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/userinterfacedesign\" rel=\"tag\">userinterfacedesign<\/a>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->",

                "content": "<h3>Introduction<\/h3>\n<p>The past <span title=\"Not full time mind you\">9 months<\/span> I have had the pleasure and the privilege to work on one of holland's biggest websites, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anwb.nl\/\"><abbr title=\"Algemene Nederlandse Wielrijders Bond\">ANWB<\/abbr>.nl<\/a>. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot. I also had the pleasure to work with a great team and I thank you <a href=\"#thanks\">guys<\/a>, you know how you are.<\/p><p>As this was the biggest jobs I have ever done, I will take the time to share my experience with you.<\/p>\n\n<!--more-->\n<h3>History <em>( or why )<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>ANWB had been working with a custom built cms and it began to show the wear and tear of being used and added to in too many years so they decided to go for a complete rebuild. What it lacked was a plan during the development phase was a master plan, so all of these nice features worked against each other. The worst thing was that is was slow ( and to me, that it produced really horrible front end code ).<\/p>\n<p>First we researched on what kind of cms they needed. After some time we decided on <a href=\"http:\/\/hippo.nl\/\">Hippo<\/a>, a dutch open source cms. This had some implications: as hippo does not come with a front end right out of the box, so we had to build one ourselves. The reason for that is obvious, once you look at it. Hippo manages content and does that really well. They let others serve that content so that they can focus on their job.<\/p><p>They asked me to do the front end, - css, html and javascript - and to help others in that field by coaching and teaching<\/p><h3>Techniques <em>( or what and how )<\/em><\/h3>\n<h4>Cocoon<\/h4><p>We built the front-end using <a href=\"http:\/\/cocoon.apache.org\/\">apache cocoon<\/a>, which turned the xml from hippo into decent (or so I think) xhtml. The XHTML is only about the structure, not about presentation or behavior. This helped us to built some really versatile and robust templates. There are only 7 templates that serve several thousand pages, so versatile they had to be. Quit a few had some <a href=\"#overhead\">overhead<\/a> in them that made it even more important that they were robust.<\/p><p>We also used cocoon and the <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/compressor\/\">yui compressor<\/a> to concatenate and minify the js and css files, something that greatly reduced the number of http requests. It also gave us the freedom to write well documented code and seperate the code into a large number of small files. Each of those files is for something different : we got js files for small functions with half the filesize being comments. When we serve it to the customers, they only get one file instead of 50, without any comments in it which would only increase the file size.<\/p>\n<h4>HTML<\/h4><p>The html was one of the most important bits of the site, as all of the other stuff (css and js) can't work well with it. The XHTML is one of the most important parts of the front end design, as it is the base upon the other two (CSS and js) work upon. It was refined during several revisions as requirements got clearer. It is one of the >aspects of this project that I am proudest of.<\/p><p>It is valid xhtml 1.0 transitional and as semantically correct as possible. So : no <code>.redborder2px<\/code> classes in the <a href=\"#css\">css<\/a> or superfluous div's (thinking of a large dutch <span title=\"postbank.nl\">bank<\/span>...). Not everything is perfect, but most of these things come from third parties, so they are out of our control. The bad thing is that some of these (banners and iframes) multiply our loading time by an x-factor, but alas, that is the real world for you.<\/p><p>Everything should work in all major browsers (we did a variation of the yahoo browser support). In fact the development started on firefox and safari on a mac and IE testing started only after 4 months of building.<\/p><p>Now if we only could educate the editors how to write proper markup, but alas. That is one of the disadvantages of a real world job: you never know how people will use it.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"css\">CSS<\/h4><p>The CSS is also as valid as possible, though it is not completely valid, as we used various CSS versions, as well as some IE specific stuff. The IE declarations are all nicely tucked away in its own conditional stylesheet and no more than the absolute minimum of declarations were used. quite a feat for such a large site...<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"javascript\">Javascript<\/h4><p>The javascript was done with <a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> but some older applications still used some  <a href=\"http:\/\/prototypejs.org\/\">prototype<\/a> that we had to rewrite.<\/p><p>Prototype extends some of the native javascript functions in the global namespace, so this collided on some occasions. We rewrote some of the prototype code like <code>prototype.extend to prototype.prototypeextend<\/code> so it would play nice with the rest of the javascript code.<\/p><p>We made sure that the javascript was as unobtrusive as possible, something that worked out well in pages we had control over but not so good in the older applications... We also used event delegation which helped us to increase the performance.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"overhead\">Overhead<\/h3><p>The real challenge lay in incorporating the more than 40 different applications into the new templates, css and javascript. Some of those were written in the middle ages and the average origin of these was about 1873. What they produced in html is not quite what we wanted and we had a lot of fun tweaking stuff until everything was working.<\/p><p>We also learned a lot from this, stuff like rewriting parts of prototype and jquery for <a href=\"#javascript\">instance<\/a><em>needs rephrasing, not clear<\/em>. We also had to check the javascript that wrote parts of the page and correct the invalid html with even more javascript. Some had js to close unclosed div's which provided a challenge...<\/p><p>As an idealist I wanted to rewrite those so called applications, but as a pragmatist I didn't (at some urging from the project manager). The cost would have outweighted the benefits but hopefully some will be rewritten in a proper fashion soon.<\/p><h3>Conclusion<\/h3><p>At the end of the project we can look at some nice results, the total amount of http requests has gone dramatically down. We started with as much as 15 external css files and 10 external js files, which we reduced to one. We also managed to get rid of all of the inline styles and scripts as well as tables for layout.

They are too well written, with tons of attributes and files to edit in order to configure them.\r\nI don't want that, so I wrote a simple plug in just for auto tab.<\/p>\r\n<h3>HTML<\/h3>\r\n<p>The itch was caused by a project where the client wanted three fields for the date and wanted autotab from day to month to year. After that the user should tab himself further... I searched for a plugin as I am a lazy bastard, but the plugins available where too much for me. Some even had me giving id's to the input fields, something that I could not do as they are placed by jsf that <em>generates<\/em> id's for you. So I wanted a simple solution based on my situation, which is not an uncommon one I think.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have three input fields on the page, with maxlength attributes so that the user could not enter wrong dates.<\/p><pre><code>&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"2 \/&#62;\r\n&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"2\" \/&#62;\r\n&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"4\" \/&#62;\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>As a user would want to have autotab on the page they would have to change the html to have a class of <code> autotab <\/code> on the input's that he wanted to have autotab, like this:<\/p><pre><code>&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"2\" class=\"autotab\" \/&#62;\r\n&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"2\" class=\"autotab\" \/&#62;\r\n&#60;input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"4\" \/&#62;\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Note that we need the <strong>maxlength<\/strong> attribute to make this work. I will explain later why...<\/p>\r\n<p>All a user has to do to use the plugin is, include jquery on your page and the plugin, than write in you own code in the document ready function:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function() {\r\n  jQuery('input.autotab').autotab();\r\n});<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<strong>Presto<\/strong> you are done, let the script take over and relax.\r\n<h3>the plugin<\/h3>\r\n<p>The plugin works like this, first we define that it is a plug in, something that I picked up reading this article.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\njQuery.fn.autotab = function (){\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Then we set it up to trigger on key up, as we need to measure the amount of code entered <em>after<\/em> his input.<\/p><pre><code> jQuery(this).keyup(function(e){<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>We then set up a couple of keys to be ignored as they only get in the way. For instance, if you let the tab key trigger the function it will not let you enter the field using shift tab. So no undo for you buddy...<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>switch(e.keyCode){\r\n    \/\/ ignore the following keys\r\n      case 9: \/\/ tab\r\n        return false;\r\n      case 16: \/\/ shift\r\n        return false;\r\n      case 20: \/\/ capslock\r\n        return false;<\/code><\/pre><p>Once we have that sorted, we can decide it is time for action, so we will begin<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>default: \/\/ any other keyup actions will trigger <\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>First off we read out the maxlength of the targeted element and put it into a variable<\/p>\r\n        <pre><code>var maxlength = jQuery(this).attr('maxlength');\r\n        \/\/ get maxlength value<\/code><\/pre><p>Once we have the maximum of characters, we seek the current amount entered. (here is why we do key<strong>up<\/strong> instead of key<strong>down<\/strong>.)<\/p><pre><code>var inputlength = jQuery(this).val().length;\r\n        \/\/ get the length of the text<\/code><\/pre><p>If the amount of characters is equal or more than the max length<\/p>\r\n        <pre><code>if ( inputlength &#62;= maxlength ){\r\n          \/\/ if the text is equal or more\r\n          \/\/ than the max length<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Set the focus on the next field<\/p>\r\n          <pre><code>jQuery(this).next('input[type=\"text\"]').focus();\r\n          \/\/ set focus to the next text field<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<h3>Enjoy<\/h3>\r\n<p>Go and get the code <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/js\/plugins\/autotab\/autotab.js\" title=\"autotab.js\">with comments<\/a> here or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/js\/plugins\/autotab\/autotab.min.js\" title=\"autotab.min.js\">minified<\/a>, let me know what you think of it...<\/p>\r\n<p><em>And thanks for reading this far... :)<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\r\n<p>Technorati Tags:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/javascript\" rel=\"tag\">javascript<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/jquery\" rel=\"tag\">jquery<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/userinterfacedesign\" rel=\"tag\">userinterfacedesign<\/a>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->",

                "content": "<p>Nowadays, everybody has (or should) heard of event delegation, the new gray in javascript. It has many advantages, such as cutting down on the event handlers javascript needs to set on a page. But there is one advantage, that not many people talk about. So I will.<\/p>\r\n<p>First we will start with the most talked about stuff, to refresh your memory, or to give you a short introduction in the matter. In short there are two kinds of calling your events from your html, inline scripting and unobtrusive javascript. The latter has a variation called Event Delegation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Inline scripting is the one we all know and the one that is not considered <em>Best practice<\/em> anymore. What you do is call the event from inside your html, like this:<\/p><pre><code>&#60;li onclick= \"alert('foo');\"&#62;inline script&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>The disadvantages of this are multiple, one is maintenance, file size is another.<\/p><p>The correct way to do this, as all the cool kids know, is with unobtrusive javascript. That way you have smaller file size, easier maintenance and so on. So what you do in html is:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>&#60;li&#62;foo&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>And you set your events with the javascript on load, page ready or what not:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\/\/ go through the dom and attach a click on every li\r\njQuery('li').click(function(){\r\n\t\/\/ do something when clicked.\r\n\talert('foo');\r\n});<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This is a step up, but it has a couple of disadvantages. As the number of event handlers grow, the time needed to add them increases. Not that this is a problem on any real browsers, but as long as IE6 continues to be used, you have to work with slow browsers. Enter <strong>Event Delegation<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>With event delegation the amount of events you have to attach shrinks by a lot, as you can put them fairly high up, like on the body. So with identical html, in your javascript you do something like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\/\/ attach a click handler on the body (one)\r\njQuery('body').click(jQuery.delegate({\r\n\t\/\/ when a li is the event target do stuff\r\n\t'li': function() { alert('foo'); }\r\n}));<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This generates only one event handler, making it way faster another advantage of event delegation comes into play when you add elements to the dom, you don't need to attach the events again, as the handler is attached to a higher level.<\/p><p>So here is the deal, not only you get less code, you get even lesser code. Everybody wins!<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are some links about event delegation should you be wanting to know more...

Learn the lessons, issues and best practices developed from integrating Enterprise Ajax applications with Adobe Air.<\/blockquote>\n<p>This one I skipped, sorry Sergey, as I don't see the need for a large framework like Backbase (or dojo for that matter) to use with air.<\/p>\n<h3>HTML \/ JavaScript desktop applications on Adobe AIR. (Chris Brichford)<\/h3>\n<blockquote>Learn how add desktop functionality to an HTML application running on Adobe AIR on the desktop. Learn about using the drag and drop API, the file system API, and other Adobe AIR APIs from HTML.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Another mac, the only presenter without one I walked out. Chris talks more about the security sandbox aspects of air. They build two sandboxes that have different priveleges and that can talk to each other, to do this they use iframes.<\/p><p>He shows a nice demo in html and how to enhance it with air. Adding state and stuff like an application menu and how to do that cross platform.<\/p><p>He also stresses to close your connection after you are done with that. I wonder if that is what causes the memory leak of air?<\/p><p>Chris had a nice talk but the overall impression still stands, nothing to hardcore today and all of the stuff is available online...<\/p>\n<h3>Using JavaScript Frameworks in AIR Applications (Andre Charland)<\/h3>\n<blockquote>Learn how to leverage JavaScript libraries and Frameworks to build HTML and JavaScript-based AIR applications. <\/blockquote>\n<p>Author of enterprise ajax, blogger on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideria.com\/\">inside ria<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitobi.com\/\">entrepreneur.<\/a><\/p><p>He talks about frameworks that work with air, not all of them work well so be warned. Air's strong point is that it works across platforms and it uses html, so that the ui is consistent in air and html parts of the app. You can use javascript to further enhance this experience, by using the same shortcuts for instance.<\/p><p>He shows us snitter as a demo and a more serious application called salesforce, that syncs data online and offline for instance and shows you your network status.<\/p><p>He is working on sh.air, a really cool file manager which lets you sync all kind of files across multiple computers (maybe users too). One thing that bugs me, but is his good right, is that his products are not open source but closed and you have to pay for that. Maybe strange but I expect javascript stuff to be free, maybe it is just me being dutch...<\/p><p>He has a ton of stuff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitobi.com\/air\">online<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>AIR Conditioning (Lee Brimelow)<\/h3><blockquote>Join Lee Brimelow as he shares his experiences developing a wide range of AIR projects, from simple widgets to larger applications that enable users to interact with software on a more intimate level on the desktop. Lots of prototypes and code will be shown to help get you up to speed with AIR development.<\/blockquote>\n<p>He writes on two websites doing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotoandlearn.com\/\">video tutorials<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/theflashblog.com\/\">the flash blog<\/a>, the slides are on the second one.<\/p>",

Serge will show you how to use Flex Builder 3 and the command line tools to sign and package your application, how to use the install badge, create custom install badges and how to keep your application up to date.<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/sergejespers.com\/\" class=\"vcard fn url\">serge<\/a> demostrates the world smallest video player, it plays hd in 16 by 16 pixels.<\/p><p>He then goes on with the presentation.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><h4>step 1, get a certificate<\/h4>\n<p>From thawte.com for 299 $ for one year with firefox. This to get a green (thrustworthy) icon in your installer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><h4>step 2 deploying your app<\/h4>\n<p>using the standard install badge is one way.<\/p><p>Another way is to use the beta install badge, looks nicer and has extra features. You can get it <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.adobe.com\/wiki\/index.php\/AIR_Badge\">here<\/a><\/p><p>The third way is to use a custom install badge, something you can build your self, so looks and functionality is up to you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><h4>step 3 Update your application<\/h4>\n<p>He gives us 5 steps to do this, these I will hope to link to later, he will post them on his site. He explains how this is easy with flex in contrast with flash. As it already has a lot of stuff in it, to make development easier.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Adobe AIR API Overview (Daniel Dura)<\/h3>\n<blockquote>Receive an overview of the new APIs that Adobe makes available to applications. Both  and JavaScript examples will be shown.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Daniel Dura gives an overview of the most used api's, like window a subject you could spend a full day on covering it. He just covers the basics, normal window, lightweight window and utility window. Startmove() function is one of the reasons that I see myself writing air applications, it gives you so much extra functions...<\/p><p>After the html api, he goes to the File I\/O api. This is the one that gives air so much extra over web applications. With this you have the possibility to read or write stuff to you computer. Make sure to close your filestream though, otherwise you will lock your computer..\n<\/p><p>Drag and drop \/ clipboard is another powerfull api to enhance the users experience. It enables the user to interact with your application in a <em>normal<\/em> manner, something that cost so much more trouble with just javascript.\n<\/p><p>For more info look at his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieldura.com\/\">site<\/a>, which has the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieldura.com\/archive\/updated-air-example-code\">slides<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Data Intensive Enterprise AIR Applications (Enrique Duvos)<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\nThe need to optimize data handling and transfers in RIAs has become increasingly important in Enterprise applications. During this session Enrique will take a look at how the combination of Adobe AIR's offline local caches via SQLite, and its native connectivity to Adobe Livecycle Data Services data management services, gives developers a powerful framework to deliver data intensive RIAs outside the browser.\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The first one which tell anything about preformance. Heard nothing about air's memory leak though. Explains the way that you can build flex and air apps with the same code base that talk to a java backend, very nice...<\/p><p>He shows a way to synchronize the data between client and server, in a nice way. You can check the connection and see if it's up or down, furthermore it can see if data is the same on or offline. Not sure if you have to use adobe's lifecycle though...\n<\/p><p>Maybe you can read about it on his <a href=\"http:\/\/flex.typepad.com\/\">site<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction to SQLite in Adobe AIR (Peter Elst)<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\nLearn all about local database support with SQLite in Adobe AIR, how the use the available API's and build a complete data driven application from scratch. This session will help you get started with several tips and tricks on how to work with data in your desktop RIA's.\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This is the one I hope to learn a lot from, if only pointers to where to start. It looks really easy, minimum amounts of code to do cool stuff. Paging is build in in a nice (not new) way, almost equal to mySql. Transactions look like a nice way to do lots of stuff in a fast and secure way.\n<\/p><p>I still don't know how the html is rendered in the air client, which is webkit and how it can or will affect performance...  This will not be a problem with flex, which creates flash (imho).\n<\/p><p>Drag and drop is a part of flex\/air that they are proud of showing, it is super easy and being shown now for the third time.  Peter is using a trial version of flex builder, apparently all the money went to our lunch. Still this is by far the most interesting presentation so far, very good. The level is right for me, a bit over my head so I learn something but not too much.<\/p><p>He has a <a href=\"http:\/\/peterelst.com\">site<\/a>, which has the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterelst.com\/blog\/2008\/04\/07\/introduction-to-sqlite-in-adobe-air\/\">slides<\/a> on it.<\/p>",

                "content": "<p id=\"topP\">As javascript is maturing at a fast rate, so are developers and designers of web applications and pages. At first javascript was a frowned upon language and profession, that has changed. Now we see a situation where javascript is being called upon to help the back end developer extend the functionality. But it can also work in other fields, the user interface design part for instance, in ways that not many people are doing.<\/p>\n<p>Not by creating superficial animations and such, but by understanding the needs of the user and anticipating on them.  Today such a situation presented itself to me.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to know what I am talking about you can skip to the demo  demo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/demo\/scrollToTop.html\">page<\/a> here, make sure you come back to check out the explanation...<\/p>\n\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Reducing<\/h3>\n<p>You know of the need to help the visitor of your page with extra functionality. For instance a <em>'scroll to top'<\/em> link at the bottom of your page, like this.<\/p>\n<pre><code>&#60;a href=\"#topP\" id=\"scrollToTop\"&#62;scroll to top&#60;\/a&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Useful, if it is needed, but rather <strong>useless<\/strong> when  the whole page is already visible to that visitor. All you do is give the visitor yet another link to be distracted by, not help him. That link should only be visible when it is needed.<\/p>\n<p>That is where javascript comes into play. With a few simple lines you remove the link from the visitor when he has no need for it.<\/p>\n<h3>How?<\/h3>\n<p>First you need to know the height of you viewport, for that we turn to the infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quirksmode.org\" rel=\"met\"><abbr title=\"Peter-Paul Koch\">PPK<\/abbr><\/a> with his script that does just that.For the script and the explanation I direct you to his page about this script which you can find on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quirksmode.org\/js\/findpos.html\">quirksmode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We then use this script to see where on the page the link is. First we check if the link is one the page, only than we do something. We get the height of the viewport and the y-position of the link and calculate the difference. If the link is above the fold, we give it a class of <em>inViewPort<\/em>.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\n>> = linebreak\nfunction hideScrollToTop(){\n  \/\/ we start by seeking the height of the browser\n  var height = (typeof window.innerHeight != 'undefined' >>\n  ? window.innerHeight : document.body.offsetHeight);\n    \/\/ first we seek the link with class of scrollToTop\n    var up = getElementsById('scrollToTop');\n    \/\/ if the link exists.\n    if(up){\n    \/\/ we get the coordinates from the ppk.\n    var coors = findPos(up);\n    \/\/ we then extract the y position\n    yPos = coors[1];\n    \/\/ we calculate what's left..\n    var left = height - yPos;\n    \/\/ if the link is 'above the fold'\n    \/\/ aka if there is a positive number left.\n    \/\/ we give it a class of 'inViewPort'\n    if( left &#60;= 0 ){\n      up.className += ' inViewPort';\n    }\n  }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In css we set the display of <em>inViewPort<\/em> to none and we are off.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\n.inViewPort {\n  display: none;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>So there you have it a way of helping users by reducing visual clutter instead of putting up more stuff. You can find the script working on it's own demo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/demo\/scrollToTop.html\">page<\/a>, with all of the javascript needed in the head. Go and play with it.<\/p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p>Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/css\" rel=\"tag\">css<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/html\" rel=\"tag\">html<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/userinterfacedesign\" rel=\"tag\">userinterfacedesign<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/web\" rel=\"tag\">web<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->",

These gold brothers now decorate the hall. What's interesting is that a full three years of being kept in a cold and damp place hasn't affected them a bit. Makes you wonder about all the worries people have about painting in museum's. When I made these paintings I was smoking sigarettes, something a lot of my fellow students did, some of that work now hangs in museums where it is treated with more care, than ever intended by the artist...\n<\/p><p>These three paintings are part of a series of everyday objects I painted in 1994 - 1996. They represent a hinge and a glove.<\/p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/57462165@N00\/2321031410\" title=\"View 'IMG_1015.JPG' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2397\/2321031410_735d298cd3_t.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1015.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"67\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/57462165@N00\/2321031480\" title=\"View 'IMG_1016.JPG' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3103\/2321031480_ace15f2de9_t.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1016.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"67\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/57462165@N00\/2320218529\" title=\"View 'IMG_1017.JPG' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3144\/2320218529_661d5e66fd_t.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1017.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"67\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a>",

I have to say, I am impressed.<\/p>\n<p>No it will not be me main browser, as it is does not run on os x without parrallel's and I have several browsers, for several tasks. Firefox 2 and 3 for developement and camino for browsing. But as IE is still the biggest browser on the market, I have to test with it.

Much is to say against it, as many did, but the basic reason for the IE team was (flawed) but admirable. They saw so many sites break during the transition of ie 6 to 7 that they wanted to ease the transtion. There is something to say in that the standards aware developer could easily go the extra distance to let <strong>IE 8<\/strong> be a good standards compliant browser<\/p><p>The downside of this was that many sites would not do this and the forward movement of the web would be slowed in the least. As the majority of web developers are not well educated and aware of standards, but frontpage using <strong>*^&%$#<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, that some people were not amused in the web development community, to say the least. There were a couple of people for it, other were clearly against it, some were on the fence.

A solution which did not, to my surprise, comes with mac support. Yes, still in this day and age, we mac users represent a minority and are very scary. Knowing that I had no support I still took the gamble as I had the right to return everything within 48 hours. Something that gave me the freedom to try and make it work.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMy first attempts were not working and even a bit frustrating. I followed the instructions and they only resulted in a blue and a <strong>red<\/strong> flashing light, but no connection. A situation which was not that common to me as I expect things to work. I have a mac and truly expect things to work when I plug them in...\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSo, as I didn't figure it out in time, I turned to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vodafone.nl\/zakelijk\/klantenservice\/contact\">Vodafone<\/a> helpdesk, fully expected to be confirmed in my bad expectations. What was my surprise, they (or the one guy I talked to Mark B.) actually helped me.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThey were very honest about not supporting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/nl\/macosx\/\">leopard<\/a> but still had a few pointers for me. Those turned out to be very helpfull, so I will repeat them here for you in the hope that I can help someone else...\n<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>\nIt turns out that leopard comes with a few drivers that conflict with the vodafone ones. So if you simple erase those and than install the vodafone software, all is well.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSo if you want stuff to work, go to <em>systeem\/bibliotheek\/extensions\/IOSerialfamily.kext\/contents\/plugins\/<\/em>, look for packages like: <em>AppleWWANSupport1.kext, AppleWWANVerizon.kext<\/em> erase those, restart and install the vodafone stuff you're done.\n<\/p>\n<p>So to conclude, some helpdesk people actually help you and here is a way to use the vodafone stuff on leopard. I hope that this helps someone...\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p>Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/web\" rel=\"tag\">web<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/umts\" rel=\"tag\">umts<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->",

This is the second of the three way shootout and I was curious as I didn't know anything about green valley. I heard a couple of things, to be honest no good things, but I tried to keep an open mind. After all, all of the three vendors deserve a honest chance, not that my opinion is that important. But after the preliminaries lets start with my impression of green valley.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe first session started of not too great, they were late by half an hour. Than they experienced some technical difficulties, to put it mildly. They counted on a good internet connection with access to certain ports, which they did not had. This hindered the demo a great deal, as they did not had a working enviroment locally. To put it mildly, they were not able to walk through all of the scenarios that we wanted them to, thus hindering us in getting a good impression of the whole system.\n\n<em>So lesson learned today is: <strong>Come prepared<\/strong>. A while ago I had a presentation session on presentation by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterketel.nl\/\">Peter Ketel<\/a>, who strongly stated that you shouldn't depend on technology. He was right, put in this mix a presenter how couldn't stick with his own story and wandered all around it and you got yourself in quite a situation.<\/em>\n\nThe content of the presentation self was quite good, they showed some good features, such as friendly url's. The overall impression of the editor site of the cms was not consistent, meta data is being added in a confusing and potentially dangerous way. Features look added without much thought about the total picture, but for the need to check all the questions in a standard RFP<em> (Request For Proposal)<\/em>. So they did not necessarily added to the usability of the product, better fewer but balanced features than more (Ipod anyone).\n\nThe technical session went not much better, as they still were not able to overcome the limitations of the technique and had brought a slow laptop. This happened to hippo too, why is that, don't these people test their stuff and buy a faster laptop for stuff like this? The tech guy who they rushed in did his best but didn't know his audience so he wasted our time explaining what a tld was and such.\n\nOverall though this session went way better than the first one, they showed some interesting things. The way to produce templates was easy but, according to them I still needed a training to do it. To be honest something I took as a insult of my intelligence, as I have been doing this stuff for a while now. But as I said before, they didn't know their audience, so I  won't hold a grudge. Further more they showed that they used (valid?) xhtml, but served to a browser in such a way that Internet Explorer still renders it as tag soup. They had more of those slips, such as in response to my question they admitted that the heard of Yahoo!'s research in front end load, but obviously hadn't looked past the title of Nate's presentation at @media.\n\nfirst Impression:\n<h5>Not good<\/h5>",

Something they did not push, as they gave enough room for other options, from jsf, flash, echo2 to .NET.\nThe advantages that they gave where (among others):\n<ol class=\"advantages\">\n\t<li>Try it for free, the software is 100% free.<\/li>\n\t<li>Transparent marketing<\/li>\n\t<li>Support is our core business<\/li>\n\t<li>Road map is open, even for discussion<\/li>\n\t<li>Releases are constant and iterative<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nThese advantages they compared to 'other' (closed source) systems as:\n<ol class=\"disadvantages\">\n\t<li>Sales driven<\/li>\n\t<li>Supports goal is to ignore bugs<\/li>\n\t<li>Unclear road map<\/li>\n\t<li>Hit and run tactics<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<em>They had better points, but I forgot to write them down, I will update with the complete list once I get it.<\/em>\n\nBeing open source, they had surely thought about commitment. They have over 1000 developers contributing code , they organize conferences (apachecon) to maintain contact with the community, they support and contribute to open standards. Doing this they have over 150 downloads a month, to be honest, not an impressive number in my humble opinion.\nIn the morning session, they focused on the end user, the authors and editors. To do this, they showed an impressive texteditor, xopus, that cleaned up word documents and stuff. Sadly, during a coffee break they admitted that it wasn't free or open source and did not work in firefox.\nOverall the application looked nice (using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.famfamfam.com\/\">fam fam fam icons<\/a>), flexible and easily configurable.\nThe main disadvantage that I see in comparison with the other two, is that they do not offer a complete solution. You have to build your own way to get the cms content on the web. This is where the other two will offer (I think) a more complete solution.\nOn the other hand, I think that this will be their main advantage. You can use the community to easily build a front end in exactly such a way that you want.\nFirst impression?\n<h5>Very good<\/h5>\nThe presentation was pleasant, although I long for friday, three days of presentations from 9.30 through 16.30 is heavy, that I know after the first day.",

(saying that in a ' do as I say, not as I do' kinda way.) I mean, for the most part the front end code that I see and , to be perfectly honest, some that I deliver is not very wel crafted. I mean, take a look at some of the code that I am working with right now:\n<code>\n#k-192-560-1 {\n  width: 195;\n  margin: 0px;\n}<\/code>\nThe basic idea was very simple, I see that (as you can). The developer started from a graphic design of some sort and thought: ' this part is divided into two column's of 192 and 560 pixels wide'. And on they went, naming some vital part of the code completly wrong. Omitting values and inserting them in places where they aren't needed.\nThe fun thing is that people don't do these things to bug you, but still. The naming is far from semanticly correct and now is second on my list. The problem which these people hadn't considered was that different browsers show things differently.\nA utterly new concepts I found out some 10+ years  ago...\nAnd after you go through a couple of box models, the naming doesn't quite makes sense anymore. And don't even start about a different graphic design in a few years or months...\nThe first place on my list is (still going strong) <strong><code>.alignRight {\ntext-align: left;\n}<\/code><\/strong>\nDo any of you have simular examples, to share, please do.

People satisfied with implementing some break points, resizing the browser and stop at that. Thing is, we all started that way, at least I did. So I will tell you my progress over the years, doing responsive developement.<\/p>\r\n<h4>2009<\/h4>\r\n<p>At first I simply was satisfied with resizing the screen. That worked for a bit, as in those days, we simply didn't know any better. And if we did anything responsive it sure beat the fixed width design they had. Some of the time I played with my shiny iPhone 3g, seeing how it looked in there. I had no other phones and was (mistakenly) convinced that all webkits were created equal.<\/p><p>Things changed when a co worker brought his new Android in to the office and yet another bought a blackberry. It seemed that things weren't that simple anymore...<img src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/18\/T-Mobile_G1_launch_event_2.jpg\/299px-T-Mobile_G1_launch_event_2.jpg\" style=\"float:right; padding: 1em 0 1em 1em\"><\/p><p>But still it was custom for us to simply change the window width and leave it at that. Clients cared only for iPhones, if they cared at all. Most of them simply built a mobile version of their website, despite what we tried to tell them.<\/p>\r\n<h4>2010<\/h4>\r\n<p>The iPad sure as hell pleased us, it was new, it was shiny and it worked like a charm.The one browser dominating the mobile space as well as chrome conquering the world let us write for one browser and one alone. At least, that is what some of us did. All we needed was <code>-webkit<\/code> and all was well.<\/p><p>At least it seemed that way, some of us discovered other browsers and different devices. Those people, not all of them, wrote code to work in more than one browser. That made it more work, but also more fun.<\/p>\r\n<h4>2013<\/h4>\r\n<p>In this day responsive web design has become the new Ajax, as it's a buzz word anybody wants. Most people don't know what it means and simply want a) a smaller sized desktop site or b) a stripped down version of that same site.<\/p><p>Some people have heard of 'mobile first', but most still don't understand it. Most of the big clients I worked for in the past few years have something of a device lab, but it is hidden away with the test department. I have yet to see that devices are on the desk with developers and even more important designers.<\/p>\r\n<h4>2014<\/h4>\r\n<p>Thinking that this responsive thing is something with a future I decided to change that. No more hunting for test devices when I am at a project. From now on I will bring my own device lab to clients, that way I can do some real work on those devices all the time. I can develop and test faster and I can show to the designers right away what their design is doing on those devices.<img src=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BfYUU6MIgAAzteI.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding: 1em 1em 1em 0;\"><\/p><p>So if you are going to hire me, be warned. I come with a minimum of 10 devices so I need a big desk and plenty of power sockets for these. Put me right between the other developers and the designers and tell them I can be asked questions. If you give me the chance I will teach people all I know about doing development for these devices.<\/p><p>As a bonus, I can talk to business and marketing people, some times without shouting, trying to educate those people as well. So if you want someone helping you with responsive web development, try and hire me, I will be happy to help.<\/p><h5>The devices<\/h5><p>Here a small and incomplete sampling of the devices I carry with me.<\/p><ul>\r\n<li>Nokia 625 - Windows<\/li><li>iPhone 3g - iOs<\/li><li>iPad (original) - iOs<\/li><li>Samsung Galaxy S2 - Android<\/li><li>iPad (retina) - iOs<\/li><li>Nexus 7 - Android<\/li><\/ul><p>There are still some things missing, I have no Firefox phone and am looking at a Nokia Asha 501.

                "content": "<p>\nI recently came across something that I can only describe as a flaw or a bug in the myFaces implementation of a tag. The tag in question is the <strong>h:outputText<\/strong> of the tomahawk myFaces tags. It seems like a straightforward tag as you look at it, or use it.<\/p>\n<pre><code>&#60;h:outputText id=\"tagId\"\n\tvalue=\"#{dna.project.projectPart.value}\"\n\tconverter=\"converters.valueConverter\"\/&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>\nWhat it renders is almost as simple:\n<\/p>\n<pre><code>&#60;span id=\"jsfGen:tagId\"&#62;value&#60;\/span&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Nothing to it, you might say. A simple way of putting data on a page, using a simple tag.\n<\/p>\n<p>But, if you have some sloppy coding and someone forgets to put an id on the tag, something weird happens<\/p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h3>Problem<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>span<\/strong> surrounding the data, a simple html tag which you might use to style it according to some degree, simply disappears. So if you do this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&#60;h:outputText <span style=\"\n\ttext-decoration: line-through;\">id=\"tagId\"<\/span>\n\tvalue=\"#{dna.project.projectPart.value}\"\n\tconverter=\"converters.valueConverter\"\/&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>It leaves you with nothing more than this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>value<\/code><\/pre><p>So what I hear you ask, the data is still there and that is true. But missing the span tag can cause serious trouble for the front ender how is styling you application. If you do not know that omitting the <strong>id<\/strong> causes the tag to render without a span, you have some serious searching ahead of you, as the missing id is the only thing that is different. In the example above it is easily spotted, but in real life, you often have to search through multiple lines of code in multiple xhtml documents, making it easy to overlook.<\/p><p>As I found it, it is kinda logical, as the output text tag only outputs text and nothing more. Only when it needs a tag to apply the id to, it renders one. But doing this results in unpredictable html rendering, where the styling or the javascript can be harmed as they both want a predictable result of html to address.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>The quickest way to solve this problem in an existing project is to agree on <strong>Coding conventions<\/strong> in which you set that you always set an ID on h:outputText. By doing this, you will easily spot the mistakes and will be able to correct them.<\/p>\n<p>What I propose is a very simple solution, rebuild the tag in a subtle manner so that it always renders the span. In that way we do not have unpredictable results in our html and everybody lives happily everafter...<\/p>\n<h3>How?<\/h3>\n<p>What I think is that rewriting the tag in order to always creates a span surrounding the data, leaves us with a more simple tag and should not need much work...<\/p><p>Now, I need to figure out how to rewrite a tag, anybody out there who can help me...<\/p>",

                "content": "CSS coding is easy and simple, people think. So you don't really need to think about it, people think. This is, as you may or may not know, wrong. In this piece I will tell you how I think you should think about CSS code, which first of all is real code, as in computer code.\n\nI talk about it as real code, in contrast to <em>a nice styling trick<\/em>. It is a very valuable and necessary addition to the toolkit of anyone working with the front end of any website or web application. As it is more and more valuable, the need to professionalize this grows, hence my two cents, in the form of my own CSS coding conventions.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Introduction<\/h3>\nIn my daily work I write and deal with a lot of html and css, sometimes from a lot of different parties, sometimes with a large team. These other parties vary in skill level and interest in html and css. In my own way I try to cope with that and some time ago, I started to sending the parties involved a piece of documentation, common enough in java development, the <strong>coding conventions<\/strong>. By doing I ensured that the code was always written more or less the same way, following the same rules. Most conventions are common enough, <em>use small-caps<\/em>, <em>use tabs set to four spaces to indent<\/em>, <em>place every selector on a seperate line<\/em> and more like that.\n\nBut a few are more abstract and in my opinion worth sharing. These describe the more global principles of good css developement. Here I will share some of my <em>conventions<\/em>, that I use daily and have been perfecting for quite some time now... No one of these are sacred and surely are open for <a href=\"#author\">improvement<\/a>.\n<h3>Start BIG<\/h3>\nBegin with styling the main elements and then differentiate for the smaller elements. This will seem obvious, but it can prove quite a challenge, if you don't think your code through well enough.\n<em>for instance;<\/em>\n\nFirst set the padding and margin on the body element:\n<pre><code>body {\n\tpadding: 0;\n\tmargin: 0;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd than set exceptions in smaller settings:\n<pre><code>#content p {\n\tpadding: 2px 6px;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\nStarting big also minimizes the need for code rewrites. When you define stuff like the width of elements, define these values as few times as possible. For instance, use 100% or automatically defined width for nested elements and let the width of the parent define that of it's children, this to ease maintanance.\n<h3>END small<\/h3>\nIf you start big and end small, the further you dive into the DOM tree, the less code you should write. Use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firebug.com\/\">firebug<\/a> to check you code, if you see a lot of striked through lines, you should rewrite and rethink you code. Please keep this in mind, especially if you use shorthand notation as it is tempting to do so quickly. But if you do, the need to re-specify something later on can be greater than needed.\n<h3>Use <span title=\"shorthand\">shrthnd<\/span><\/h3>\nuse shorthand notation when possible and appropiate see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.456bereastreet.com\/\">roger johansson<\/a> for an excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.456bereastreet.com\/archive\/200502\/efficient_css_with_shorthand_properties\/\">article<\/a> on shorthand.\n<em>do use when:<\/em>\n\n<em>multiple declarations are necessary, like: <\/em>\n<pre><code>\n\tpadding: 6px 0 3px 12px;\n\tbackground: url(foo.gif) no-repeat 6px 12px #fff;\n\talso use short hand to write less code:\n\tpadding: 0; instead of padding: 0 0 0 0;<\/code><\/pre>\n<em>\ndo not use when only one value is to be set:<\/em>\n<pre><code>\n\tpadding-top: 4px;\n\tbackground-color: #CCC;<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Prefix<\/h3>\nin order to use and not get tangled by the CASCADE of css, use a prefix for different sections. For different sections start declarations with a starting selector of #foo, so they do not influence stuff outside it. With other words, using a 'prefix' lets you use the CASCADE, without being bothered by it too much. Nice for the ones among us who struggle with specifity...\n\nSections who use this technique will be marked with <strong>'PREFIXED'<\/strong> followed by the selector used as a prefix.\nThis section should be marked as such:\n<pre><code>\/*\n\tPREFIXED #foo\n\tcomment that describes the section\n*\/\n#foo {\n\tdo: something;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\nPrefixed sections should end with;\n<pre><code>\n\/*\n\t\/PREFIXED #foo\n*\/<\/code><\/pre>\nThis way, the scope of the prefix is obvious. The start of the prefix is also the place to put comment about the section you are describing. The more you comment, the better it is maintainable. We stript the css of comment and such before production with cocoon, so go wild :). To easily spot your sections, you can now search for <em>PREFIXED<\/em>, or you can choose to indent your prefixed sections heavily to help you spot them in your code.\n<h3>Semantic coding<\/h3>\nThis one I am going to give you is the most important one and it far supersedes it's initial meaning. It should influence the way you write your (x)html and javascript, as it forces you to think about the whole of your code and not only the css side of it...\n\nIt even has consequences on the very back-end of your application or site, as even the jsf or .NET code should be structured with this in mind. Be prepared to some heavy arguments over this one, as you will be stepping on someone elses toes.\n\nThe most superficial ones are in simple things like naming conventions, but those could provide an ample challenge, if you just started thinking this way. Avoid classnames and ID's that describe how things should look, always seek for names that describe what an element does. The visual aspect of things tend to change more often than the functional aspects.\n<em>So do use names like:<\/em>\n<pre><code>#content, .articleIntroduction and so on.<\/code><\/pre>\nDo NOT use names like:\n<pre><code>\n#column456px, .blackLink and such bad ones.<\/code><\/pre>\nBe very mindful of these rules, as it is easy to stray from the straight path...\n<h3>Future proof<\/h3>\nWhen writing css, do not be hindered by older browsers, use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/CSS21\/\">CSS 2.1<\/a> or even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Style\/CSS\/current-work\">CSS 3<\/a> when appropiate. To accommodate 'older' browsers (ie 6 and below) write specific style-sheets that should be included using conditional comments. In this way we can be sure that future browsers are supported and older browsers not left out. Please be careful of maintenance pit-falls, as writing too much code to work around a (for instance) 'adjacent sibling selector' is not always a viable solution and should be decided on a case by case basis.\n\nEven using javascript to resolve browser inabilities is something to be decided with caution, as there is no clear line between the good and the bad way to do this...\n\nWhat I mean, is using a small script to select last children the right way when using it for small elements, or is there a certain size you should not exceed? If there is, is it set to 5 or 50 elements, I don't know. You should, in my opinion, rather use class-names set by your back-end and avoid the infamous <em>flash of un-styled content<\/em> which you will notice if you depend on javascript to much. Again, this decision you will have to make on a case per case basis.\n<h3>Mind the GAP<\/h3>\nWhen writing code, please comment thoroughly and think your logic through. In time your code will be maintained by someone else, who may or may not have your skills and knowledge. To help ease the transition, comment excessivly and please cite freely of the sources you use to reach your conclusions.\n\nFollow the standards of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/\">w3c<\/a> and describe when and WHY you use a 'hack' (or patch). Make sure that your code is valid css and html. If you have to write an invalid section, please comment on the why and how.\n<h3>Afterthought<\/h3>\nNone of the first ones have any influence on the working of the code and can be easily solved by agreeing on a similar tool for coding. These rules, or guidelines, only have influence on the appearance of the code, not the working of it. Others mainly deal with how you structure your code ,ease maintenance or even speed things up in a browser.\n\nThe most important thing however is that if you work with more people on a project, you will need to communicate. As none of those conventions are any good, if not all of your team members comply with them.\n\nThis is especially true, if you have different people working on different sections of the site or application. If these people all work following the same conventions, you can have a team that is more than the sum of it's parts. This is because you have more freedom in self-set limitations, as it frees you do only think about the new problems, that inevitably will arise, not about inventing the wheel again.",

Bummer is only that it doesn't work in IE, the one browser that needs javascript debugging most. It also throws javascript error in IE when used. That is something that can be avoided by cleanly remove all of those console.log statements <strong>before <\/strong>you send stuff to be tested.\n\nBut, as everybody knows in the real world people tend to forget such things. So in annoyance with these errors, I set out to recreate the basis console.log function for IE as well. In retrospect it turns out that I set out to create a better mouse trap, but hey, it was fun and good enough to share, so lets...\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn my solution and do not worry, I will share other solutions but first I will speak my mind. The console.log function is not used, instead you use <em>logger(message). <\/em>This sends the message to message to the console, if there is any, or it creates an ul (with an id of 'logger') in which it sets li's with the individual messages. So without further ado, I present to you the code:\n<pre><code>\n \/*\n * wilfred nas\n *\n * info@wnas.nl\n * http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/\n * http:\/\/snippets.wnas.nl\/\n *\/\n\n\/\/ to intitialize the logger set : var log = 'true';\n\/\/ change to 'false' to remove logging statements from you app.\n\/\/ or (better) remove all logger statements from your code.\nvar log = 'true';\n\/\/var log = 'false';\n\/*\n * the logger functionality is a attempt to recreate some of the console functions of\n * fire bug for IE, the browser where you need js debugging tools the most. *\n * to use it you replace console.log(msg) with logger(msg), this sends the msg to the console or\n * it creates an ul to receive your (LIst of) messages...\n *\/\n\/*\n * works in  safari 2, opera 9, camino, webkit, ie 6 and firefox 2 (with or without firebug).\n *\/\nfunction logger (msg){\n    if (log == 'true'){\n        \/\/ first we need to do some browser sniffing, look below for the explanation.\n        var b = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();\nsafari = \/webkit\/.test(b);\n        \/*\n             we only sniff what we need...\n            opera = \/opera\/.test(b);\n            msie = \/msie\/.test(b) &amp;&amp; !\/opera\/.test(b);\n            mozilla = \/mozilla\/.test(b) &amp;&amp; !\/(compatible|webkit)\/.test(b);\n        *\/\n\/\/ bummer, safari seems to think that it has a console, so we make sure that it goes through.\n        if (window.console &amp;&amp; !safari){\n                console.log(msg);\n            }\n        else {\n            if(!document.getElementById('logger')){\n                var ul = document.createElement('ul');\n                ul.id = 'logger';\n                document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(ul);\n            }\n            var ul = document.getElementById('logger');\n            var li = document.createElement('li');\n            ul.insertBefore(li,ul.firstChild);\n            li.innerHTML = msg;\n        }\n    }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\nI think that it is a nice solution to a real problem, if you want see my <a href=\"http:\/\/snippets.wnas.nl\/examples\/logger\/index.html\" title=\"logger example\">solution here.<\/a> If you want to try other people's solutions, go and seek <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.nl\/search?q=console.log+for+ie&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\" title=\"google search for console.log for ie\">googles<\/a> advice. Something that I should have done before writing my own stuff, but at least it helps me understand javascript a bit better. Something that is always good I think.\n\nMy advice to you is, either use my solution (and if you do, please let me know, I will be proud) or go and use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wait-till-i.com\/index.php?p=394\" title=\"faux console\">faux console by Christian Heilman's<\/a>. I think his is better javascript, as is to be expected...\n\nThe downside is that he wrote it to be included as a seperate piece of javascript and it still needs to have all of the <strong>console.log<\/strong> statements removed for the live code. Where as in my logger, all you have to do is change <strong>var log == 'true'<\/strong> to <strong>false<\/strong> to go live. I think that this is a strong point, in my situation where I deliver stuff to be tested in two day cycles, as it goes faster.",

More different, or simular things are popping up now, things like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/\">twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/\">tumblr<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAs the possibilities grow, which will you choose, you can choose to take 'm all on, but to what purpose and in what time. I don't know about you, but for me there are just to few hours in a day. The time I spend online for me is not strictly for pleasure, but also for business purposes. So I try and do stuff as efficiently as possible.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n<p>Sure, I can choose to take on everything, but will I have something to tell about anymore, I don't think so. I blog about my work experience, talking about code and stuff, I use twitter to <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitr.com\/wnas\">tweet<\/a><\/em> about my daily ramblings and I plan to use my own <a href=\"http:\/\/wnas.tumblr.com\">tumblr<\/a> as a digital clipboard.<\/p>\n<p>\nBut, what is the problem, a great many people do not know what to do with each medium, thus treating them all the same. How do we (including myself) tackle this problem, how do we maintain blogs that interest people, twitter streams that attract readers and a tumblr thingamagic that, ok I just started tumblr and should find out more about that before I give an stupid and unfounded opinion...\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Not that that has stopped me in the past, or in the future for that matter, but hey, for the sake of this article, assume that I am a polite and thorough individual.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>The point is, how do we make sense of the kaleidoscope of possibilities. What do we use to what purpose?<\/p>\n<p><em>\nThe answer is simple, use each tool where it is meant for and not for anything different. As a boy I used to <\/em><em>help<\/em> my dad doing chores, I didn't help out more than any other boy of about 6 (no more in fact than my boys do now), but I did learned an important lesson. Use a hammer to hammer and a screwdriver to screw. By doing this, you let the tool do what it does best and hinder you. I think that you can figure out what happens if you try to loosen a screw with a hammer. The same thing applies to things like blogs, twitter and tumblr. Best is to use each tool to do what they are good at...\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSo, what are the tools at hand good for? Lets analyse a few methods of sharing your mind on the web and discuss it's pro's and con's<\/p>\n<h4>Bloggin<\/h4>\n<h5>pros<\/h5>\n<p>\nA blog is good for collecting and displaying thorough thought, even a link log is only a good one if it has vision. It needs a  vision and a goal, not that those things should be heavy, but it seems hard to me to fill your blog with baby kittens and hardcore c++ snippets and not confuse people... So you have to select your goal and stick with it\n<\/p>\n<h5>cons<\/h5>\n<p>\nNo good for jotting occasional ramblings, you have to keep at it, to satisfy your readers, you have to post regularly. And if you post, do not post something trivial. Respect the time of your reader as he or she is giving you by writing something worthwhile.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Twitter<\/h4>\n<h5>Pros<\/h5>\n<p>\nTwitter is great as a shoutbox and it sometimes gives instant feedback. I like the insights it gives me in to the daily lives, that people are giving me, although it sometimes is a bit weird. To see total strangers share stuff about their lives. It sometimes makes me feel like a peeping tom, to see what people share about their lives. Some things are fun, but I can imagine that some things are better left unsaid.\n<\/p>\n<h5>Cons<\/h5>\n<p>\nI do not know what exactly to make of twitter as of now. What I know is that some people treat is like an anonymous shout-box. But <em>anonymous<\/em> it is not, it is an free online service that is available for anyone to read. And by anyone, I mean anyone, also your clients and (future) employers. So don't go overboard is my advice and think before you shout. Although that doesn't count for yelling <em>IE is driving me mad<\/em> once in a while if you are an web developer...\n<\/p>\n<h4>Tumblr<\/h4>\n<h5>Pros<\/h5>\n<p>\nAs I said above, I haven't been using it for a long time, and for now only use is to dump fragments of code to. The same thing that I started this blog for a couple of years back. With tumblr I feel no obligation to write thorough and thoughtful pieces, this frees me to just post useful pieces of code that won't make it into an article (yet). Therefor, I post more information online for people to see, read and use.\n<\/p>\n<h5>Cons<\/h5>\n<p>\nI think that the same policy should go for tumblr that you should use for twitter, use with caution. Tumblr on the other hand is more of a blog, in that you can edit your post, to possibly censure your self.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>\nAll of these tools have their own merits and can help you very well. If you use your twitter, you don't get tempted to shout on your weblog, tumblr can help you set up pieces to share and keep and not publish half finished articles. Each of these tools can enhance the other, they are so different that they do not get in each others way but enhance one another.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThese sources that I talk about in this piece are not the only ones of their kind. So please, go look around the web for alternatives and try them out. As you do, you will be able to form your own solid opinion.\n<\/p>\n<p><em>\nPlease find your own way with these applications and use them wisely. My opinion of these is not the only, so I advise you to form your own opinion on them.\n<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p>Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/tumblr\" rel=\"tag\">tumblr<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/twitter\" rel=\"tag\">twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/wordpress\" rel=\"tag\">wordpress<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/ajax\" rel=\"tag\">ajax<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->",

Everywhere ajax is popping up, it is being used for good and, in a lot of cases, bad. Most of these implementation errors are being made on two separate fields, development and design.<\/p><p>In this post I  will try to clear a few things up, to prevent some of the most common errors to be repeated.<\/p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Mistakes<\/h3>\n<p>Ajax has been the new gray for a while now and like every hype, it has made it's way into the mainstream. In part this is a good thing, as many sites and applications are being made to better the users experience, are the not. Unfortunately not all of the ajax implementations are being done right and a lot of them make the same mistakes. In this post I will try to let you see the mistakes and the (both  <span title=\"in my humble opinion\">imho<\/span>) easiest or even wisest solutions.<\/p>\n<h4>Being cool<\/h4>\n<h5>The problem<\/h5>\n<p>First we start with the most common design and development mistakes being made, trying to be <strong>cool<\/strong>. Many people add ajax to there application or website without thinking, just to get on the ajax wagon. To be fashionable, to be hip, to be cool, to please the unknowing client or project manager that kept asking for ajax, or some other reason that I don't know.<\/p><p>Don't get me wrong,I see a lot of application and websites that use ajax very good, to bring a better user experience to their user, not to show off some skill of the developer. I know, it is a fun thing to do, showing off, that is, but please don't do it...<\/p><p>In my opinion, ajax is old technology, so why bother with it, in order to show of. So you can implement xhr and manipulate parts of your page without a page refresh. So what, we could do that back in 1999, thanks to Microsoft, lets not forget that folks. So being cool by implementing a 8 year old technique invented by the big bully of the web, I don't think so.<br \/>Now that we settled this, lets look at the truly cool things about Ajax.<\/p>\n<p>Ajax lets your users save time, if implemented right, that is if designed right. Implementing it right makes sure that it degrades gracefully, works in all modern browsers and doesn't throw javascript errors or memory leaks. All of that is not that exciting and <em>almost<\/em> easily done. Take on of the, more and more, mature javascript libraries or pieces of code by gurus like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quirksmode.org\/\">PPK<\/a> and modify them to fit your need. So now we settled the issue, the technique called Ajax is not cool.<\/p>\n<h5>The solution<\/h5>\n<p>Be humble, make sure that it is all about the user, not about the developer. In order to help you, hire a user interface designer and a requirements analyst to find out what your users really want. In that way you are using the technique to benefit the user, the way it is supposed to do. The technique ajax is not cool, enriching your users experience is. To do this you first have to know who they are and what they want. If you have a small project and do not have the means to hire a special someone to do this, hire someone who has at least a bit of knowledge of user interface design and let him make up <em>persona's<\/em> to work for.<\/p>\n<h4>Frameworks<\/h4>\n<h5>The problem<\/h5>\n<p>In my daily work I work with a lot of talented people who can work wonders with java or .net code. Very smart developers who can make the back-end of an application or website get you coffee and wash your car. There is a certain part of their work where they (or at least 95% of them) try to stay away from. The big and bad <strong>Frontend<\/strong> piece of their application, all of this kiddy stuff like html, css and javascript is simply not worth their attention. They are, after all, serious programmers and can not be bothered by this stuff. So to avoid that they use frameworks like ajax4jsf and similar ones on .net or jsp. In this way they can satisfy their clients, who demand Ajax, and still keep their hands clean.<\/p><p>What they do not know, or want to know, is what kind of code those frameworks generate. And that is what a user uses, with all of it's quirks and minor annoyances. Most of these frameworks that I have seen, have never heard of unobtrusive javascript for instance and write lines and lines of javascript into your html. There is also absolutely no separation of structure, presentation and behavior in those frameworks, at least not that I know of. For the most occurrences this will not be a problem, but in the case that it is, solving problems in a framework that you use like a black box and have no knowledge of is not easy.<\/p><p>This is extra strange, as I have seen those same developers, who do not try and learn anything of the front-end, leap through hoops in order to learn a new java framework. So they are willing to learn, but perhaps in a constrained way...<\/p>\n<h5>The solution<\/h5>\n<p>The solution to this problem can be found in a couple of ways. If you insist on using frameworks, study them thoroughly and get to know them really good, if you don't do that, you place yourself in a really fast car, without a steering wheel. As you have the speed of development by using a framework, but without a thorough understanding you don't know where you are going. Most jsf frameworks that I know are open-source, so you can improve the framework and give that back to the community. In that way you solve the problem not only for yourself, but for colleagues around the globe.<\/p><p>If you really take your job seriously, go out and learn javascript, css and html. There are enough resources on the internet to help you make a running start. You don't have to be an expert at any of these, just learn enough that you can implement <span title=\"XML HTTP request\">xhr<\/span> with a javascript library like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a>. If you can do that, you have more control over things when they go wrong and trust me, when you deal with browsers, things have a tendency to go wrong. Plus you have another technique at your disposal, which can't hurt either.<\/p>\n<h4>Ajax vs Dom-scripting<\/h4>\n<h5>The problem<\/h5>\n<p>When people turn to frameworks to do their ajax magic, another problem tends to pop up. Since it is so easy to do Ajax like stuff, people tend to over use their ajax thingamagics. Using ajax to disable or enable a formfield for instance, because it <em>surely looks like ajax<\/em>. What happens here, is that people have to little understanding of the front-end that they assume that everyone that has to do with manipulating the front-end is ajax.<\/p><p>What they not know is that there is more to ajax than just manipulating the dom, ajax is about communicating with the server and <strong>then<\/strong> manipulate the dom to reflect a change in that same page, <strong>without<\/strong> refreshing that page. The main difference is that people confuse domscripting with ajax.<\/p><p>That confusion comes from not knowing what your framework does, from not knowing what goes on at the front-end of your application.<\/p>\n<h5>The solution<\/h5>\n<p>For this you have a simple solution, simply learn the trade. Go to sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alistapart.com\/\">alistapart<\/a> for your basic front-end knowledge, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajaxian.com\/\">ajaxian<\/a> for everything ajax or many more like those, hey you may even pick up a thing or two from my site... Basically, take the solution I offered for your framework problem and work with that. <\/p>\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>So here we go, I added my two cents to an ancient discussion in the web community, hoping that maybe some back-end developers will pick it up.<\/p>",

In this post I will point at some of the advantages of using a library. In these posts I will focus on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jquery.com\">jQuery<\/a>, as I am familiar with it and comfortable in using it. jQuery can be replaced with any library of your choice, as the people of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prototype.org\/\">prototype<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/dojotoolkit.org\/\">dojo<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/mochikit.com\/\">mochikit<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/extjs.com\/\">ext<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\">YUI<\/a> are all equally focussing on speed and ease of use. The reason that I personally use jQuery is, with the reasons I gave in the last post (css like syntax and its shorthand) also its fabulous and (in my opinion) unique documentation. See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visualjquery.com\/\">visual jQuery<\/a> for a complete description and examples for it's core use.\n<!--more-->\n\njQuery has a lot of advantages over plain old javascript, not in the least it's ease of use. Imagine your self writing a piece of javascript to implement adjacent sibling selectors for ie 6 and below... There is a reason that people don't want to use this in browsers, it is to frigging difficult to get it to work, not the mention the maintance difficulty you are getting yourself in. In jQuery it is as easy as writing the css.\n<pre><code>input[type='text'] + span.info { margin-left: 5px; }<\/code><\/pre>\nThe above meaning, as you should know, a span with a class info which comes after a text input field gets the left margin. Stop for a moment and contemplate how to write this in javascript...\n\n* Go and find all of the spans with the class info in your document\n* build a node list of these\n* check if they have a previous sibling which is an text inputfield\n* then give those a class\n* build css to give the left margin\n\n<em>And never, ever give the left margin in the js, that is mixing behaviour and presentation and that is bad js fu, ask Dan Webb<\/em>\n\nEven if you want to do all that, you have to do that for every single instance that you use Adjacent Sibling Selectors.\n\nIn jQuery, you just write:\n\n<pre><code>$('input[type='text'] + span.info').addClass('infoAfterInputText');<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd in the css:\n\n<pre><code>.infoAfterInputText{ margin-left: 5px; }<\/code><\/pre>\nI think that you can easily imagine which one is easier maintanable...\n<h3>Why<\/h3>\nThe reason that I think these things are important is that they make it possible to harness the true power of css. For instance, about 2 years ago, I had to write a menu that was quite straight forward. But the difficult thing was that it consisted out of two different sections, between which we toggled easy enough with javascript, but looked entirely different.\n\nThis created a lot of css, as the things we set on one state had to be countered in the other state. By using a line like;\n\n<pre><code>#menu &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; *:first-child<\/code><\/pre>\nI could strip something like 40 lines of css from the menu style-sheet, quite good. And that is not saying anything about the maintainability of the code, all we had to do in js was:\n\n<pre><code>$('#menu &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; *:first-child').addClass('foo');<\/code><\/pre>\nIn the css we had to add the class <strong>.foo<\/strong> off-course in a separate style-sheet which we included using <em>conditional comments<\/em>\n\n<pre><code>\n<!--[if lte IE 6]>\n\tStuff you want only IE to see\n\tlike css or js files you use to 'educate' IE\n< ![endif]--><\/code><\/pre>\nSo if you want to use cutting edge css and are looking for a tool to help you control that unwieldy Internet Explorer, go and checkout jQuery. Make sure that you use the packed version in you live code and use the unpacked code to read and understand. The two are not only different in file-size, but also in speed. You see, jQuery has been written with lots of comments, so if you know anything of js, it is readable...<em>Or am I turning into a bigger geek than I thought..<\/em>\n<h3>Examples<\/h3>\nSo when do we use jQuery to patch the DOM, well that is up to you. I do it in these cases:\n\n<dl> <dt>Adjacent sibling selectors<\/dt> <dd>If I see an absolute advantage in using these over zillions lines of code that only contradicth the original line,  I will use them. Always heavily documented, as these are the more obscure css properties that not many people know or use.<\/dd> <dd>\n<pre><code>\n<strong>CSS<\/strong>\np + a {\n\tdo: stuff;\n}\n\/* if an 'a' element comes after a 'p' element, do stuff *\/\n<strong>jQuery<\/strong>\n$('p + a').addClass('foo');\n\/\/ basically the same thing\n<strong>extra css<\/strong>\n.foo {\n\tdo: stuff;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/dd><dt>Direct child selectors<\/dt> <dd>Sometimes you want to use a direct child selector, to (for instance) minimize you css.<\/dd> <dd><code> <\/code>\n<pre>\n<strong>CSS<\/strong>\np &gt; a {\n\tdo: stuff\n}\n\/* if an 'a' element is a direct child of an 'p' element, do stuff *\/\n<strong>jQuery<\/strong>\n$('p &gt; a').addClass('foo');\n\/\/ again the same thing\n<strong>extra CSS<\/strong>\n.foo {\n\tdo: stuff;\n}<\/pre>\n<\/dd><dt>Even and odd<\/dt> <dd>If you want to zebra a table the hard way, you can use CSS3 selectors to do this. Please keep in mind, that this is (at this moment) not supported by any major browser, or for that any browser that I know of...<\/dd> <dd>\n<pre><code>\n<strong>CSS<\/strong>\n.class:nth-child(2n) { do: stuff; }\n<strong>jQuery<\/strong>\n$('.class:nth-child(2n)').addClass('foo');\n\/\/ I think that you get the idea by now...\n<strong>extra css<\/strong>\n.foo {\n\tdo: stuff;\n}\n\/*\n\tplease note, that the <em>extra<\/em> css is in fact necessary for any browser,\n\tso these will not be included just for IE. Please document very extensively.\n*\/<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/dd><\/dl>This kinda stuff will help you implement some cool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/2001\/CR-css3-selectors-20011113\/%23nth-child-pseudo\">css 3<\/a> stuff as well. So in a way, the future is now...\n<h3>Word to the wise<\/h3>\nThese tricks may and can be nice, but must be used wisely, as they have influence on quite a few things on your page\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Preformance, javascript, however cleverly written adds to the time it takes browser to render your page<\/li>\n\t<li>Maintenance, even if you thoroughly comment your code, placing declarations in two places always makes more room for error. Please know that one day you will have to let go of your code and the next guy or girl may not know his or her stuff as well as you do, so please keep that in consideration<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\nBy using a library, you ensure that the code is being written in a way that the library dictates. This is a bette as that ensures that people taking over your code can read about it online, rather than your ( if you are like me ) shabby documentation. The additions that you use are open source and (if you are lucky) well documented, that insures the continuation of your project, if you leave. That is in the real world a really good way to insure client satisfaction...\n\nSo use all of the tricks that you have at your disposal, but use them wisely. Do not try and show off your skills on a client's website, that you do on your own personal site. Keep a few personal pages around to try and show of your skills rather than burden a client with the risk...\nThus first and foremost be professional and have fun.",

Performance, compatibility, the user interface \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any aspect of MarsEdit 2 that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been improved from version 1. Plus there are new features like Flickr integration. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been using the 2.0 betas to write Daring Fireball for months.<\/cite>\n<p>I must say, that the interface, while it takes some getting used to, is better than the wordpress one, that I have been using for a couple of years now. That one has the quality of something that you have been using for a long time, you forget the quirks or have your own workarounds. Meaning, that after a while, you don't notice the bad things anymore, you just get used to them.<\/p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.red-sweater.com\/marsedit\/\" title=\"Easy weblog editing.\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.red-sweater.com\/images\/MarsEditBadge.gif\" height=\"31\" width=\"88\" alt=\"MarsEdit: Powerful Blog Authoring Made Simple.\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>But, as some of you may know, I read a great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/2005\/02\/16\/death-of-a-thousand-stings\/\">tale<\/a> about the difference in user interfaces a long time ago and it also applies to blogging.<\/p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/09\/picture-11.png\" alt=\"Picture 1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"193\" \/>\n<p>To counter that, MarsEdit's interface is a bit more simple, no toolbar for formating on the top for one. To me this is good, I like to add a <strong>strong<\/strong> tag myself when I feel like it and the wp interface would try and screw it up...<\/p><p>Furthermore, I think that this is a far better tool to write with in the train, something that I will be doing more in the future. This is part of my <em>Grand master plan<\/em> to make <strong>WNAS<\/strong> a even better place to go and read up on web dev stuff.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/09\/picture-2.png\" alt=\"Picture 2.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"348\" \/><p>As you can see MarsEdit has the interface that I like, simple and unobtrusive. But, it doesn't stop there, there is an image upload utility that rocks. This also has flickr integration, something that will definitely enhance my posts, as adding images is just made easy.<\/p><p>End conclusion, this is one to keep...<\/p>",

After more than 3 years of working with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lucka.nl\/\" title=\"lucka consultancy\">lucka,<\/a> which is a new record for me, I have decided to go at it alone. The years at lucka have been nice, but I think it the time to start my own business again.\n\nWhy do you ask, well let me tell you\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<em>I woke up one morning and it just came to me, from a big light in the sky: <\/em>\n\n<em><strong>\"GO FORTH AND FREELANCE\"<\/strong><\/em>\n\n<em>And so I did offcourse, as everybody knows, there is no ignoring big lights in the sky. Bigger men than me (and those have to big, as I am 192cm) have tried and failed. So forth I went, to take the freelance path... <\/em>\n\nJust kidding folks, in the past 15 years I have been working independently more than I have been employed. After due consideration I decided that it was time to do it again. In the past I have had good and bad times as a freelancer, but the good was more present than the bad. So I have more than enough expierence in working freelance, to see it's advantages en it's disadvantages. In the end it was the freedom to be my own boss that did it, as I always have been an independent fellow.\n\nMy experience also has grown that I am confident enough to take on the challenge, after all I do have more than 10 years of expierence in web work. I started out as a graphic designer bitching about developers to finally become the developer that I started out bitching about. During that time I have learned a thing or two about both the technical and user side of web design, worked for a large number of clients and done quite a couple of nice things.\n\nI plan on doing more of less the same work, providing clients with excellent user interface development and design. Further more I am still working on other things to do. I want to teach, I want to write more, launch a product or two, pick up painting again, maybe do some coaching and what more...\n\nBut the most important thing that I plan to do is spend more time with my family and have fun and challenging projects to work on.\n\nSo if you have some work for me, don't hesitate to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/?page_id=305\" title=\"contact page\">contact<\/a> me...",

                "content": "<p>The last couple of years I have been using other people's JavaScript popup calendar's, for use in different projects. Almost all of them did the job nicely, but they all had a disadvantage. All of them used tables to layout the popup calendar, something that seems logical if you see the layout. But it isn't, a calendar is not tabular data, it is a simple list...<br \/>So I went out and created a different rendering method...<\/p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>To be honest, that was about everything me and a colleague (eric de vries) did. We based our calendar on the fine work by Matt Kruse that you can find <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mattkruse.com\/javascript\/calendarpopup\/\">here<\/a>. A couple of thing were off and those we added and changed.<\/p><p>We for instance were obliged to show three different fields, one for the days, one for the months and the last on for the years. Those had to followed by an icon of a calendar, that should popup a calendar field where our users could visually select a date.<\/p><p>The trouble we had with this set up was that is just wasn't semantically sound. Especially if javascript was turned of for instance... We had to render three input fields, which had the purpose to collect a simple date. We had to render an icon, that could not work without javascript.

                "guid": "http:\/\/www.wilfrednas.com\/?p=216",
                "content": "In the last couple of years I have been writing more and more javascript, starting like everyone else (?) with copying and pasting. But as time went on, first I thought up good ideas for scripts and having someone else write them. And in the end, writing the scripts myself.\n\nI have been using several librarys over the last two years, not all of them a lot, but enough to have at least some idea of what you can do with them. My favorite  was,  and is, jQuery as it let you do stuff easily. That is equally true of just about every library, once you get the feel of the syntax. The main advantage of jQuery for me is that it's syntax so closely resembles css, which I have been using a lot for 5 or 6 years now, and that it is fast.\n\nBut, the truth is, I have found something that is even faster! <!--more-->It is called <strong>POJO   <\/strong>and that stands for: Plain Old Javascript Object. I know, it is harder to write javascript code by your self and not let a library do it, but it does have it's advantages<em> (and yes, I know that it is being used for plain old <strong>java<\/strong> object)<\/em>. First let me tell you of the disadvantages.\n\nLonger, code written for a library, like jQuery, is much shorter. Take striping tables for instance, with POJO, you could write\n\n<code>\nfunction stripe() {\nif (!document.getElementsByTagName) return;\nvar even = true;\nvar elemTable = document.getElementsByTagName('table');\nif (elemTable != null){\nfor (var t = 0; t &lt; elemTable.length; t++) {\nif ((elemTable[t].className == ('results' || ' results') {\nvar elemBody = elemTable[t].getElementsByTagName('tbody');\nfor (var b = 0; b &lt; elemBody.length; b++) {\nvar elemRow = elemBody[b].getElementsByTagName('tr');\nfor (var r = 0; r &lt; elemRow.length; r++) {\nif (elemRow[r] != null) {\nif (even)\nelemRow[r].className += (!elemRow[r].className) ? 'even' : ' even';\neven= !even;\n}\n}\n}\n}\n}\n}\n}<\/code>\nIn this little snippet, I look for a table with a specific className and stripe it. Pretty straightforward and not the best implementation around, but it gets the job done.\n\nIn jQuery, I only have to write:\n<code>\nfunction stripe(){\n$(\".results tbody tr:nth-child(even)\").addClass(\"even\");\n}<\/code>\nWhich is pretty damn short...\n\nWhat is the catch of this, it is fairly obvious that the last example is easier to write and understandable for everyone, even for the ones with only css knowledge, as it's syntax is so similar.\n\nThe catch is, pretty simple, <strong>speed<\/strong>. The POJO solution is much quicker, as you can see on the test pages. One for jQuery and one for POJ. The results are (on my system macbook pro 2.4ghz 2gig ram) pretty convincing, the POJO does the trick in about <strong>44ms<\/strong>, jQuery needs <strong>120ms<\/strong>...\n\nThat must be convincing. Javascript librarys and jQuery claims it is  one of the fastest around and (in my opinion rightly so) take to long to compute large blocks of date. I did this experiment with 1000 table rows, I know a total usability disaster, but a good number to get a decent time to measure.\n\nMost people forget that a javascript library makes developing easier (true) but potentially hinder the end user. The time to render this is 3 (three) times as much with jQuery, than it took with plain old javascript objects. Go figure which solution the end user prefers...\n\nThis is not a rant against javascript librarys as they take a lot of work from you and make cross browser development much easier for instance. But you should not depend on them too much. Ajax development, fades, animations and drag and drop are some things that I can think of quickly as things that I will not take on without a library (or a PPK in my corner). The point is that you should allways think twice to use a javascript library, as the example proves...\n\nIf anyone thinks that I have done jQuery injustice, they should grab the zip below and prove me wrong, I know I wannabe as the lazy part of me (the bigger part to be honest) yells out loud.\n\n<a href='http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/07\/pojo_vs_jquery.zip' title='pojo vs jquery'>pojo vs jquery<\/a>",

This is the second of the three way shootout and I was curious as I didn't know anything about green valley. I heard a couple of things, to be honest no good things, but I tried to keep an open mind. After all, all of the three vendors deserve a honest chance, not that my opinion is that important. But after the preliminaries lets start with my impression of green valley.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe first session started of not too great, they were late by half an hour. Than they experienced some technical difficulties, to put it mildly. They counted on a good internet connection with access to certain ports, which they did not had. This hindered the demo a great deal, as they did not had a working enviroment locally. To put it mildly, they were not able to walk through all of the scenarios that we wanted them to, thus hindering us in getting a good impression of the whole system.\n\n<em>So lesson learned today is: <strong>Come prepared<\/strong>. A while ago I had a presentation session on presentation by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterketel.nl\/\">Peter Ketel<\/a>, who strongly stated that you shouldn't depend on technology. He was right, put in this mix a presenter how couldn't stick with his own story and wandered all around it and you got yourself in quite a situation.<\/em>\n\nThe content of the presentation self was quite good, they showed some good features, such as friendly url's. The overall impression of the editor site of the cms was not consistent, meta data is being added in a confusing and potentially dangerous way. Features look added without much thought about the total picture, but for the need to check all the questions in a standard RFP<em> (Request For Proposal)<\/em>. So they did not necessarily added to the usability of the product, better fewer but balanced features than more (Ipod anyone).\n\nThe technical session went not much better, as they still were not able to overcome the limitations of the technique and had brought a slow laptop. This happened to hippo too, why is that, don't these people test their stuff and buy a faster laptop for stuff like this? The tech guy who they rushed in did his best but didn't know his audience so he wasted our time explaining what a tld was and such.\n\nOverall though this session went way better than the first one, they showed some interesting things. The way to produce templates was easy but, according to them I still needed a training to do it. To be honest something I took as a insult of my intelligence, as I have been doing this stuff for a while now. But as I said before, they didn't know their audience, so I  won't hold a grudge. Further more they showed that they used (valid?) xhtml, but served to a browser in such a way that Internet Explorer still renders it as tag soup. They had more of those slips, such as in response to my question they admitted that the heard of Yahoo!'s research in front end load, but obviously hadn't looked past the title of Nate's presentation at @media.\n\nfirst Impression:\n<h5>Not good<\/h5>",

                "content": "<h4>Three way shootout in the cms corral - part 1<\/h4>\nFirst up in the three way shootout of cms vendors was Hippo. A dutch (Amsterdam) based vendor, who is active and profitable since 1999 in the open source community.\nBut without further ado, my first impression...<!--more-->\nHippo cms is open source, something which has it's advantages, some of which are that they have over 1000 developers contributing to the community. Furthermore they are very involved with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apache.org\/\">apache<\/a> project, hence the promotion of <em>hippo<\/em> cocoon as a front end layer. Something they did not push, as they gave enough room for other options, from jsf, flash, echo2 to .NET.\nThe advantages that they gave where (among others):\n<ol class=\"advantages\">\n\t<li>Try it for free, the software is 100% free.<\/li>\n\t<li>Transparent marketing<\/li>\n\t<li>Support is our core business<\/li>\n\t<li>Road map is open, even for discussion<\/li>\n\t<li>Releases are constant and iterative<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nThese advantages they compared to 'other' (closed source) systems as:\n<ol class=\"disadvantages\">\n\t<li>Sales driven<\/li>\n\t<li>Supports goal is to ignore bugs<\/li>\n\t<li>Unclear road map<\/li>\n\t<li>Hit and run tactics<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<em>They had better points, but I forgot to write them down, I will update with the complete list once I get it.<\/em>\n\nBeing open source, they had surely thought about commitment. They have over 1000 developers contributing code , they organize conferences (apachecon) to maintain contact with the community, they support and contribute to open standards. Doing this they have over 150 downloads a month, to be honest, not an impressive number in my humble opinion.\nIn the morning session, they focused on the end user, the authors and editors. To do this, they showed an impressive texteditor, xopus, that cleaned up word documents and stuff. Sadly, during a coffee break they admitted that it wasn't free or open source and did not work in firefox.\nOverall the application looked nice (using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.famfamfam.com\/\">fam fam fam icons<\/a>), flexible and easily configurable.\nThe main disadvantage that I see in comparison with the other two, is that they do not offer a complete solution. You have to build your own way to get the cms content on the web. This is where the other two will offer (I think) a more complete solution.\nOn the other hand, I think that this will be their main advantage. You can use the community to easily build a front end in exactly such a way that you want.\nFirst impression?\n<h5>Very good<\/h5>\nThe presentation was pleasant, although I long for friday, three days of presentations from 9.30 through 16.30 is heavy, that I know after the first day.",

The illustration at the top is one of my personal favorites, not  in the least as I created it for the birth card of my youngest son 'Pieter'.\n\nBut there were some usability issues that concerned me. Not that I lost any sleep over it, but still. There was way to little crowd participation in the form of comments and stuff. People didn't find it easy enough to navigate to other pages and such. So I changed the whole bit. Keep reading to learn what I have changed, that you can see. But more importantly, <strong>why<\/strong>?\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe comments are now fixed on the left side, or at least for people who use decent browsers <em>(cough, not IE)<\/em> to make it easier to comment. After all, it saves you one click. In the previous version of the design, you had to click the link (which had a non obvious text), to get to a seperate comment page. That didn't quite made sense, didn't it. Now you can comment as you read.\n\nFuture versions will include the fixed comment for IE and a live preview of how your comments will display..\n\nThe links to the next and previous articles are\n\nI removed the AJAX search box. Blasphemy, I hear the crowd shout, thou willst not remove any of the holy AJAX thingamics. And to make matters worse, in daily life, I implement that functionality. But let me explain my decision, so hear me out;\n\nIn the previous version of my design, the search box had a 'google suggest' kinda functionality. You typed and a max of 10 results dropped down below. Those results were reachable with the keyboard, so far so good. BUT, it didn't always work as planned in all of the browsers that I tested it in. And the results that you got were short and sometimes that hindered me. As I have always said, this is my site, so I  call the shots. So for my own purpose, a seperate page with the search results is more usable, the results are displayed with more detail, so I can have more information on which I can make my choice.\n\nAll of the css stuff is now standards and I have yet to implement some IE 6 and below fixes. The fixed comments are not fixed yet in IE 6 for instance and I think more things will tend to go wrong. At this moment I will not worry about it, as the majority of my readers do use a proper browser. I will create a seperate post, just to collect the comments on things that go wrong.",

                "content": "Many websites and applications struggle with the same difficulties, how to create a visually attractive frontend without reverting to too much extra elements. Web standards savy developers struggle each day to keep both ends happy.\n\n<strong>WARNING, rant ahead!<\/strong>\n<em>I beforehand apoligize to any designer, developer  or whoever is hurt during reading this. A small warning, if the shoe fits...<\/em>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn the one corner the 'too hip' designer, who thinks that adding just one more subtle line or shadow finally earns him the respect of his peers.\n\nIn the other corner, the 'I'm too damn good for front end' java (or .net for that matter) developer. Who doesn't blink as his IDE or framework of choice generates just one more superflues div extra. After all, it isn't his problems, that is for the 'frontend guy' to solve.\n\nThis is the tag team that I, and many web developers with me, have to defend myself against. Enter the latest trick in the book. Using the <strong>&lt;body&gt;<\/strong> element for styling.\n\nAs some people know is that minimizing code is one of my favorite thing to do. It is almost sick, but I can enjoy a proper markup, fact is: I read them on the train. This little private thing aside, I am a fully adjusted member of the human race and all, but still. Some people write code like poetry.\n\nSo when I came across an idea to minimize my daily clutter of superflues div's that are being thrown into my code by either designers of (in my case) java developers, I rejoiced.\n\nI have used a container div in my markup for years, when I needed one or when I thought I needed one  and I stopped thinking about  it all together years ago. It was just something you did, something you needed. But today I wondered if we needed that div.\n\nThe common practice for me was all this years, to start with a container div, no doubt straight out of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alistapart.com\" title=\"a site for people who make sites.\"><em>Alistapart<\/em><\/a> bible. It was so common for me, that I hardly even thought about it, untill now. Why is it that we all start with a div?\n\nWhy, to style offcource, to give a certain width to the pages content, to center it and what not. But all of these things, we can do on an element which is allready in the page, something that is needed for the actual framework of the html page, the <strong>&lt;body&gt;<\/strong> element. Sometimes things are that obvious that we don't even see them even though they are as plain as day. So instead of doing:\n<code>\n&#60;body&#62;\n&#60;div id=\"container\"&#62;\n-- the actual content --\n&#60;\/div&#62;\n&#60;\/body&#62;\n<\/code>\nWe just go:\n<code>\n&#60;body&#62;\n-- the actual content --\n&#60;\/body&#62;\n<\/code>\nSure, it is only one div that we take out, but look at the principle. Once we start out with one extra element, it will be very hard to stop from adding <em>just <strong>one<\/strong><\/em> more. It will become a slippery slope and once you start to slide, there is no stopping you.\nWith this extra div, what is one more and remember the tag team? They will say, if you can add an extra div, so can I.\n\nAfter all it is <em>just <strong>one<\/strong><\/em> more.\nGo and take a look at the css file for these pages, and you will see, that although I have a #page or other containing element present on each page, the actual styling takes place on the body. One of the main advantages is that I have only one place where I set the width, margin and other stuff. And therefor only one place where I have to change that if I ever decide to broaden my horizon and my pages.",

(saying that in a ' do as I say, not as I do' kinda way.) I mean, for the most part the front end code that I see and , to be perfectly honest, some that I deliver is not very wel crafted. I mean, take a look at some of the code that I am working with right now:\n<code>\n#k-192-560-1 {\n  width: 195;\n  margin: 0px;\n}<\/code>\nThe basic idea was very simple, I see that (as you can). The developer started from a graphic design of some sort and thought: ' this part is divided into two column's of 192 and 560 pixels wide'. And on they went, naming some vital part of the code completly wrong. Omitting values and inserting them in places where they aren't needed.\nThe fun thing is that people don't do these things to bug you, but still. The naming is far from semanticly correct and now is second on my list. The problem which these people hadn't considered was that different browsers show things differently.\nA utterly new concepts I found out some 10+ years  ago...\nAnd after you go through a couple of box models, the naming doesn't quite makes sense anymore.

After 3 years working for the dutch police it department, it was time for a change. And some change this is.\nAfter years of doing work behind the scenes, I now have a chance to do some really public work. I am currently working for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anwb.nl\/\" title=\"anwb\">ANWB<\/a> and will gradually bring them in the modern standards based work.<!--more-->\nThis is quite a job as their site has close to 10.000 pages, all of which will be influenced by what I do. What is even more challenging is that this is not a simple website, but it has dozens of applications running in it. All of this was being build by LL, who is going of to do nicer things. His shoes I have to fill, by trying to revamp things while not breaking anything.\nThat I hope to do by testing, for which I have a nice setup here. My most recent javascript thingy I tested in:\n<strong>Windows<\/strong><br \/>ie7, ie6, ie 5.5, ie 5, firefox2, firefox1.5 and opera 9\n<strong>Mac<\/strong><br \/>safari 2, safari 1.3, firefox 2, firefox 1.5, camino 1.03, opera 9, opera 8 and (drumrolls) Ie 5.2\n<strong>linux (ubuntu)<\/strong>firefox 2\nIf that doesn't cut it, I do not know. Now I only have to install lynx on a couple of machines and I am good to go.\n\nAnd I hope to devote some more time to my blog, so ya all come back soon.",

I said that I wanted to use them and I have. But after a while I came upon some limitations for use in the real world.\r\nIn this post I will describe those limitations and how I changed the code to suit my needs.\r\n<!--more-->The original code made use of Id's to identify the dropdowns and placed those Id's in the javascript code. When implementing them, I did so in web applications where the Id is owned by the back end guys. These guys often (think) that they absolutely need them and can not life without the sole ownership of the Id.\r\nFurther more, the dependancy of the id's that are hard coded in the javascript set limitations on the html code that I have to produce. And it limits the amount of dynamic selects that I can use on a page to one set. Not that it is necessaryly smart to use a lot of dynamic select boxes in a user interface kinda way.\r\nBut if you see the trend of the web these days, with one page applications. The need to include more than one set on a single page is getting more real each day.\r\nSo to come to the point, I changed the code to depend not on Id's but on certain classnames. That sets me free to include as much sets as I want in a application.\r\nSee the code here\r\n<a href='http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/files\/unobtrusive-drop\/uds.js' title='Unobtrusive dynamic select boxes (code)'><code>code<\/code><\/a>. I did my best to describe what I did in the comments, so read those and try to improve on it. Please let me know what you think...\r\nThere are two functions that are needed to make this work, first getElementsByTagName by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snook.ca\/\" title=\"jonathan snook\">Jonathan Snook<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robertnyman.com\/\" title=\"robert nyman\">Robert Nyman<\/a>   and a addition of my own (together with tino loos), GetElementValueFromClassName.\r\nGet the code here<a href='http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/files\/unobtrusive-drop3\/tools.js' title='tools'><code>tools<\/code><\/a>\r\nSee if you can use it, but believe me, you can use it in more ways than you can think of now.\r\nFor instance, use Ajax to fill the dropdowns, to easily drill down into loads of data, without letting your user wait.\r\n\r\n<!-- technorati tags begin -->\r\n<p class=\"tags\">technorati tags:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/javascript\" rel=\"tag\">javascript<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/unobtrusive\" rel=\"tag\">unobtrusive<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/css\" rel=\"tag\">css<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/html\" rel=\"tag\">html<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/internet\" rel=\"tag\">internet<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/ajax\" rel=\"tag\">ajax<\/a><\/p>\r\n<!-- technorati tags end -->",

The group (if there is such a thing) doesn't agree on what we are exactly. Do we act to change the attitude on webstandards in the netherlands or do we drink beer and talk about our work. I for one hope that whatever we do, it always includes beer drinking :).\nMore serious here, I think that we as a group have not the influence to actively change things in the Netherlands. What we can do is start (or continue) a grass root revolution, that influences people from the bottom up. In my 10+ years of webdevelopment I have had one manager that supported me in my work. All of the changes that I have been able to make, have been made with support of the common developers. And that change includes some real things as the entire dutch police developing applications based on valid html, css and unobtrusive javascript. So don't think that you need to change things from the top down only. Start by showing people what can be done with proper seperation of markup, presentation and behaviour and some (not all) will follow and become fellow standardistas who will continue to support our cause.\nI think that this will cause the whole standards movement to gain momentum slowly, but surely.\n\nMaybe it is an idea to form a standardista samurai, like the css one of 'old'. Take a big site, some happy clogs, pizza, beer and convert it to proper code and improve the usability while we are at it.\n\nAny takers?",

But something a standardista must do what he has to do in order to make things work.\n\nTo serve a style sheet to safari and opera only, I came across a simple hack. Instead of using\n\n<code>\n&#60;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" href=\"style.css\" \/&#62;\n<\/code>\n\nuse this instead\n\n<code>\n&#60;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"foo\/css\" href=\"safari.css\" \/&#62;\n<\/code>\n\nThis sets you up with a style sheet which is only read by safari and opera. As long as they don't fix it that is.\n\nAs long as it works, and I can't stress this enough so I will say it again\n\n<strong>As long as it works<\/strong>\n<p><em>Update, this doesn't work in safari 3.0 beta mac, in windows I haven't been able to test it, but I guess  that It won't work there either. Don't worry though, the hack was mostly usefull to overcome safari's inability to style input elements, something that safari 3.0 can.<\/em><\/p>\n\nIt will give you a way to serve seperate stylesheets to just about any browser today. Use the <a title=\"safari hack\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ibloomstudios.com\/article1\/\">safari # hack<\/a> by adding a # after a semi colon, to exclude stuff for safari and therefor giving opera the styles it needs (to escape possible safari\/opera problems). Use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quirksmode.org\/css\/condcom.html\" title=\"conditional comments\">conditional comments<\/a> for IE's different versions and give firefox what it needs (that is valid css) and your in business.\n\n<em>I came across this hack when developing 'internet aangifte' for the dutch police, as it needed to work in just about any browser available, which is a good thing. The only problem is that we haven't been able (yet) to fix apache struts invalid rendering of the hidden input tag. So the site is not valid xhtml, which is a pity...<\/em>",

Today, I got a piece of code a jsp tag is rendering for a results table. It contains a tfoot for some information that is supposed to go below the results, so it is semanticly  correct. But according to the w3c validator it isn't valid HTML...<!--more-->\n\nThe code is as follows:\n\n<code>\n&#60;table&#62;\n&#60;thead&#62;\n&#60;tr&#62;&#60;th&#62;header&#60;\/th&#62;&#60;\/tr&#62;\n&#60;\/thead&#62;\n&#60;tbody&#62;\n&#60;tr&#62;&#60;td&#62;results&#60;\/td&#62;&#60;\/tr&#62;\n&#60;\/tbody&#62;\n&#60;tfoot&#62;\n&#60;tr&#62;&#60;td&#62;results&#60;\/td&#62;&#60;\/tr&#62;\n&#60;\/tfoot&#62;\n&#60;\/table&#62;\n<\/code>\n\nYet the message I get from the (#$%@) validator is that is not allowed there. After some browsing I came up with a solution which suprised me and maybe will be of some use for others...The code above is indeed not as valid as it may seem.

But is so small that it took me two days to notice.\n\nIn short, the thing is frigging brilliant, the screen that is. Applications that took forever on my old (only two years) powerbook g4 to launch, are now open in a jiffy. Graphics seem so much better, in that way the new video configuration seems to work for me. I can open as much as I like and still work fast in eclipse, to do java stuff. That with 6 different browsers, aptana and photo shop open is pretty good.\n\nThe only thing I gotta test is windows, if I have that I will not need any pc's anymore.

I am  not a great coder, matter of fact is that I only recently  started coding myself. Luckily for me, is that I have spent  the last couple of years helping developers, develop some common sense. So the thought process is not enterily alien to me...\n\nEnough babbling, let's go and look at some code\n<pre>function popLink (){\n\/\/ get all the a elements with a class popup\n\/\/ see getElementsByClassName in tools.js\n\/\/(snook and nyman)\nvar aP = getElementsByClassName(document, \"a\", \"popup\");\n\/\/ build a nodelist (thanks to ppk who is making\n\/\/ me understand js with his book).\nfor (var i=0; i&#60;aP.length; i++) {\n\/\/ on click do something.\naP[i].onclick = function () {\n\/\/ get the width and height var with another help function\n\/\/ see tools.js for GetElementValueFromClassName (thnx to Tino Loos)\nvar width = GetElementValueFromClassName(this.className, \"w\");\nvar height = GetElementValueFromClassName(this.className, \"h\");\n\/\/ go to the function popup and take the href, width and heigth as attributes.\npopUp((this.getAttribute(\"href\")), width, height);\n\/\/ ignore the default action of the link.\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n}<\/pre>\nThis will do something, if we have the function popUp, so here it is...\n<pre>function popUp(winURL, width, height ) {\n\/\/ if there is no width or height is set,\n\/\/ take the default values...\nif (width == \"\") {\nwidth = 640;\n}     if (height == \"\") {\nheight = 480;     }\nwindow.open(winURL,\"popup\",\"width=\" + width--\n+ \",height=\" + height); }<\/pre>\nThis stuff will be available onload, thanx to martins events js.\n<pre>Events.attach(window, \"load\", function() { popLink(); });<\/pre>\nThe can be called upon from html with a class like this...\n<pre>class=\"popup w:900 h:700\"<\/pre>\nJoin me next time, I will go in to the helper classes.

My opinion is, that it should be avoided, but If you have to, do it correct. That is, using unobtrusive javascript and so on.\n\nThat being said, let's continue...<!--more-->\n\nThe stuff I thought were missing were, mostly, flexibility. So I went and added just that. In my script you not only can call a popup window, just by using a class \"popup\". You can also define its width and height, by adding the classes \"w:800 h:500\".\n\nNice one, isn't it...\n\nHere are some examples, <a class=\"popup\" title=\"martin's blog\" href=\"http:\/\/pebble.windgazer.nl\">a link without width or height set<\/a> and <a class=\"popup w:800 h:600\" title=\"domscripting\" href=\"http:\/\/www.domscripting.com\">one<\/a> with the  width and height set.\n\nIn my next post I will explain what I (we) have done, in the meantime, go and check the code, to see for your self...\n\n<strong>Next post<\/strong>\nThe javascript for the pop up window.\n\n<strong>The one thereafter<\/strong>\nHow to get part of a className, namespaces anyone :)\n\n<em>Maybe before that, a happy clog meeting report<\/em>\n\nLater",

Snook made sure that the draggable thingy was transparent, by setting its opacity in the javascript code like this\n\nAs I said before, I like to keep my presentation seperate from my behaviour (and structure ofcourse). So I decided to change that to:\n<pre>\/\/this.el.setOpacity(.5); \/\/ snook\nthis.el.addClassName('dragged'); \/\/ wnas added<\/pre>\nAnd to remove the className I changed\n<pre>\/\/this.el.setOpacity(1); \/\/ snook\nthis.el.removeClassName('dragged'); \/\/ wnas added<\/pre>\nOfcourse I added something in the css to let it do something (please note id added in order for the style to take effect)\n<pre>#dragger.dragged {\nopacity: .5; \/* firefox *\/\nfilter: alpha(opacity=50); \/* ie *\/\n}<\/pre>\nI hope that my two cents help anyone, to seperate behaviour, structure and presentation.\n\nHere are the files to let you test and improve it for your selfs... <a onmousedown=\"selectLink(181);\" id=\"p181\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/mootoolsdragdrop.htm\" \/>\n\n<a onmousedown=\"selectLink(181);\" id=\"p181\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/mootoolsdragdrop.htm\">the html page<\/a><a onmousedown=\"selectLink(180);\" id=\"p180\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/mootools.release.51.js\" \/>\n\n<a onmousedown=\"selectLink(180);\" id=\"p180\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/mootools.release.51.js\">mooTools<\/a>",

But his lecture gave me inspiration to give you a series of small tricks on how to use 'advanced' css selectors together with javascript snippets on how to make it work in IE..\n\nFirst of, <strong>last child selectors<\/strong>.\n\nSometimes you have to put a special emphasis on something like say a last list item. With good css you would do something like this...\n<pre>#foo li:last-child {\ndo: something;\n}<\/pre>\nbut wait, I hear you say, IE doesn't support last-child, so I can't use it. No, but now javascript comes to the rescue!\n\nAfter hearing the great <a title=\"adactio\" href=\"http:\/\/adactio.com\/\">jeremy keith<\/a> speak on javascript and how it is <a title=\"podcast\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vivabit.com\/atmedia2006\/blog\/index.php\/jeremy-keith-using-dom-scripting-to-plug-holes-in-css-podcast\/\">good for you<\/a>, I decided to take on the dom my self. After all, I have been frustrated by the lack of standards support in IE for a long time now. Time to strike back.\n\nso javascript to the rescue.\n<pre>function lastListItem () {\nvar k = document.getElementById('foo');\nif (k) {\nvar last = k.lastChild;\nlast.className += \"InExLIlast\";\n}\n}<\/pre>\nall we have to do now is extend our style sheet with the ie className, which we have given a prefix to distinguise it from the normal (read correct) css classes. So our css becomes:\n<pre>#foo li.InExLIlast,  #foo li:last-child {\ndo: something;\n}<\/pre>\n<strong>Update<\/strong>\n\nKevin, in response to your question, the function is called in the following way.\n<pre>function include() {\nlastListItem()\nsomeOtherFunction()\n}\nwindow.attachEvent(\"onload\", include);<\/pre>\nThere you go, one more trick up your sleeve.\n\nIf you have any comments, questions or something like that let me know.",

(You can find more info about them on google.) They start with tips about how to start, a equalizing stylesheet is mentioned. Which is a good thing, you first create a level playing field by removing all of the browser styling. Then you pick either a template or a framework. And start with your content.\n\nThe speakers are not on the same line with multiple css files, all I can say is my personal opinion. If you have several 1000's lines of code you have to split up your files, in a common way. By making a base.css, a  layout.css and several files for large sections of the site or application. An extra to it is that is a more easy way to remove legacy code.\n\nThey also provide some usefull tips about commenting. Such as comment (in xhtml) your closing div, and begin your comment with a common character, like = comment. That makes searching easier. The most important thing they said and what everyone knows is COMMENT a lot and good. After 6 months you cannot remember why you did certain things.\n\nAfter that they tackle naming conventions and code order only to arrive at one conclusion. You have to be consistent...",

That is adding a base href, so we can use the existing html to start with.\nGet it here <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/nu.html\">HERE<\/a>\n\nA pretty page, isn't it. Nice to look at full of news, but do not look at the source code. It is not valid to say the least, the whole page is crawling with stuff like inline styles, tables, invalid javascript and I just bet that I can find some spacer gifs...\n\nNice, isn't it. These people have not been paying attention the last couple of years. If you have missed it, a bunch of us web folks have been trying to seperate content, structure, presentation and behaviour. Let us see if we can do better...\n\nIf we look at the page we can see that is relatively simple. All it got is three columns and a logo. Wait a minute, let's google that shall we, just type in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=three+column+layout&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\">three column layout<\/a> and pick one.\nNow, was that hard, no it wasn't hard at all, just one google action got us with more information than we can read in one night. It just proves that  what I say a lot, that the information is there, all you have to do is read it.\n\nLots of people write about css, some very good, some (like me) try and fail, but you can find good sites with lots of info on them. All you have to do is read, how do you think people who are more knowledgable than you obtained that info. <strong>They looked it up<\/strong>.\n\nLet us start with the basics of this page, with all due respect, this page does not deserve this much code so we start with a <a id=\"p145\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/nu002.html\">clean slate<\/a>\">clean slate.

The gospel, as you could know if you read my site, is proper use of css and xhtml. Or strict separation of structure, behaviour and presentation.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIf you know what company I work for, you understand the slight pause I take if I tell you it's url (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lucka.nl\">www.lucka.nl<\/a>). It doesn't practice what I preach, not by a long shot.\nAfter 2 years, it is time to do something about it. Yep, now is the time to redesign.\n\nStarting with the basics, keeping the exteriour the same, but  redefining the code behind it.\n\nFirst lets look at the page that we have to rebuild:\n\n<img width=\"128\" height=\"76\" id=\"image123\" alt=\"lucka.nl\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/03\/lucka.thumbnail.png\" \/>\n\nAnd looking at it, let's start to dissect it first, what are the elements on the page.\n<ul>\n\t<li>First there is the logo top left<\/li>\n\t<li>then there is a header with buttons<\/li>\n\t<li>At the left site there is another logo and a search box<\/li>\n\t<li>And last but not least, there is content in the middle<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThis is built with 5 (or more, I can't be bothered to check) frames, tables for layout, minimum of css and if validated by w3c a total of 31 errors starting with: NO DOCTYPE.\n\nFirst of, let me explain this, you have to include a doctype. It tells the browser how you want your page to be rendered and stuff. Go and look it up on google, there are lot's of articles telling you to INCLUDE A $^*&%^$ DOCTYPE YOU , YOU...\n\nBut let us continue, we will correct all this. That we will do after we will look at the basic we will have to build and how:\n<ul>\n\t<li>First there is the logo top left\nWhich we will place on the background of a h1, of which we will hide the text.<\/li>\n\t<li>then there is a header with buttons\nThese are two unordered lists with links<\/li>\n\t<li>At the left site there is another logo and a search box\nBackground image on a small form with the search box<\/li>\n\t<li>And last but not least, there is content in the middle\nBlock of text with an image.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nA nice bonus of our plan is, that I plan to build all this w3c compliant, browser independent, accessible, faster, smaller, nicer to google and overall something I can show to my friends. (if I had some)\n\n<a title=\"PART 2\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/?p=133\">Follow me to part 2<\/a>, there we will start with some code..",

Luckily for me, right at that time came an article on alistapart called <a href=\"http:\/\/ww.alistapart.com\/articles\/boom\">Printing a Book with CSS: Boom!<\/a>. This made me set up an discussion at work, XSLT FO vs CSS, with me as an css advocate.\n\nWe (I currently work for a dutch goverment department) now use xslt and fo to print documents and I for one, believe that xlst is way to big to be used only for this. CSS is in my opinion a much better tool, as it is simpler to write and maintain. XSLT is the way to go if you actually Transform anything, but if you are going to print stuff of a webpage you don't have to do this...\n\nOne disadvantage for xslt is the larger amount of code necessary for simple tasks.\nSee this xsl example:\n<code>\n&#60;xsl :template\n  match=\"html:p[@class='copyright' and\nancestor::html:div[@class='head']]\"\n  priority=\"100\"&#62;\n  &#60;fo :block space-before=\"8pt\"\n            space-after=\"8pt\"\n            font-size=\"75%\"&#62;\n   &#60;xsl :apply-templates\/&#62;\n  &#60;\/fo&#62;\n\n<\/code>\n\nAnd its css counterpart:\n<code>\ndiv.head p.copyright {\n   margin-top: 8pt;\n   margin-bottom: 8pt;\n   font-size: 75%\n}\n<\/code>\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhich is better, that depends on the goal you wish to achieve, I vote for css. I will keep you informed of what happens at work...\n\nsurely with support for things like\n<code>\npage-break-after: always;\n<\/code>\ncss has a good chance.\n\nAlso see the site of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/\">W3C<\/a> for more information.",

In particular, a selector of the form \"[id=p33]\" is counted as an attribute selector (a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0), even if the id attribute is defined as an \"ID\" in the source document's DTD.\n\nConcatenating the four numbers a-b-c-d (in a number system with a large base) gives the specificity.\n\nExample(s):\n\nSome examples:\n\n <code>*             {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 0,0,0,0 *\/\n li            {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,0,1 *\/\n li:first-line {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=2 -> specificity = 0,0,0,2 *\/\n ul li         {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=2 -> specificity = 0,0,0,2 *\/\n ul ol+li      {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=3 -> specificity = 0,0,0,3 *\/\n h1 + *[rel=up]{}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=1 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,1,1 *\/\n ul ol li.red  {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=1 d=3 -> specificity = 0,0,1,3 *\/\n li.red.level  {}  \/* a=0 b=0 c=2 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,2,1 *\/\n #x34y         {}  \/* a=0 b=1 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 0,1,0,0 *\/\n style=\"\"          \/* a=1 b=0 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 1,0,0,0 *\/\n\n<head>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n  #x97z { color: red }\n<\/style>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n<p ID=x97z style=\"color: green\">\n<\/p><\/body><\/code>\n\nIn the above example, the color of the P element would be green. The declaration in the \"style\" attribute will override the one in the STYLE element because of cascading rule 3, since it has a higher specificity.",

It could be great with the amount of smart people at Microsoft and the amount of money thrown at it. The search results are what you expect from any decent engine (a search for wnas puts me on top). But what got me baffled is the markup of the page, which comes in at a hefty <strong>26,708 bytes<\/strong>. And that for a page which has one input field and some links... Me as a front end developer, I'm baffled by that size and kinda insulted. I have to wait longer because they used front page or what ever, no way, not in 2009 I don't.<\/p><p>The real fun comes when you do a certain magic trick called view source. Most of the size of the HTML is being formed by <strong>inline<\/strong> css and javascript. There even is a table in there, along with inline script handlers...<\/p><p><strong>1999 called and it want's it's markup back, guys.<\/strong><\/p><h4>The numbers<\/h4><p>Still I get back to the size of the page, a whopping 26,708 bytes with all the bells and whistles. If you strip the javascript alone, you're still left with just 13,462 bytes.<\/p><p>Thats <strong>13,246 bytes<\/strong> of inline javascript for you.<\/p><p>So no javascript solves the size and the waiting time? Not quite, we have inline css too. So if we get rid of that, we are left with 5,524 bytes.<\/p><p>So the css alone is <strong>7,722 bytes<\/strong>.<\/p><p>It seems that were getting there, no. No way, the html is very much too much and can be optimised to I think half of it's current size. <\/p><p>That size being <strong>5,524 bytes<\/strong> for HTML alone.<\/p><p>If they got the correct markup and got their CSS and JavaScript from external sources, the user would only had to download that once. And would get a better experience, because faster is better.<\/p><h4>Conclusion<\/h4><p>I think that the front end of this page was build by a .net developer, who thinks everybody got a broad band connection. Maybe that is the case, but I know that my patience is less now than it was when I had a 14k4 modem. If I have to wait, even for a few seconds, it's not my fault and the chance that I navigate away from that page would be greater now than it was back in the 14k4 days.<\/p><p>So Microsoft, please clean up your act and hire a decent front end developer. Maybe you could look at <a href=\"http:\/\/video.yahoo.com\/watch\/4156174\/11192533\">this<\/a> awesome presentation from Nicole Sullivan at yahoo. It shows you how much speed matters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t",

This time I booked a room in the hotel which is the closest to the venue, the Premier Inn London County Hall. No more wandering around london in the rain, as I did after a few pints at the first @media ajax november 2008. No more standing in cramped underground trains as I did at my last company sponsered visit in spring 2008.<img src=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/images\/media2009-logo.png\" alt=\"@media 2009\" \/><\/p><p>I am looking forward to seeing all of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vivabit.com\/atmedia2009\/speakers\/\">speakers<\/a>, especially the ones I haven't seen like Simon Collison and Jason Santa Maria. I'm curious on the one track arrangement, as I always had a love hate relation with the two track thing. Two of my favorite speakers would always be on the same time in a different room. I am not sure that I like the whole no-lunch thing, but I understand that the guys from vivabit had to do something to keep is affordable in these times.<\/p><p>Still the cost of a conference to me is not the ticket alone, I have to fly over and get a hotel for a couple of nights. So the cost of the ticket is only 40% of the whole, less so if you reckon  that I won't be billing clients for three days. But the real value is off-course in the speakers and speaking to lots of fellow web developers from all over europe and to that I am really looking forward to.<\/p><h3>Fronteers<\/h3><p>The other conference I am going to attend is <a href=\"http:\/\/fronteers.nl\/congres\/2009\">Fronteers 2009<\/a>. Not that I have much of a choice as I have been drafted by <a href=\"http:\/\/quirksmode.org\" title=\"Peter-Paul Koch\" rel=\"friend met\">PPK<\/a> to help organizing the whole thing. One of the advantages is that I already know which speakers we have lined up. All I can say at this point is that you really, really have to attend this one..<\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/images\/fronteers-logo.png\" alt=\"fronteers\" \/><\/p><h3>Full frontal<\/h3><p>The third one I <em>may<\/em> attend is <a href=\"http:\/\/2009.full-frontal.org\/\">Full frontal<\/a> as the speakers line up sure looks impressive for a day which costs only 100 pounds. I am not sure about this as it comes awfully close after fronteers and I may have some work to do sometime. On the other hand this could be my replacement for my yearly javascript conference fix that @media Ajax provided...<\/p><p>So if you are attending any of these, have fun and I will see you there.<\/p>",

I spend almost 8 hours teaching a dozen or so java developers about the basics ( and then some ) of proper web development. Doing this is the most nerve wrecking piece of my work, as I am not quite confident about public speaking. But it also is one of the things I love doing most, as is talking about your passion is to most people, undoubtedly.<\/p><p><em>If you wake me up at 4 in the morning, gave me an espresso and asked me to explain some web stuff I will...<\/em><\/p><p>By doing these workshops I get even more respect for some of the great speakers I have seen and enjoyed over the years.

But it also gives me an insight about my own speaking capabilities.<\/p><p>One of my goals when I started as a freelancers again some 2 years ago, was to speak at a major conference. Something I succeeded in doing at the <a href=\"http:\/\/fronteers.nl\/congres\/2008\/speakers#wilfred-nas\" rel=\"me\">fronteers<\/a> conference, if only in a panel. Sitting at the other end of a presentation is a very different thing, that I can tell you.<\/p><p>One thing I learned is that speaking does not come easy, as I was very nervous. I can get a message across and tell a semi coherent tale, but I will never be a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kryogenix.org\/days\/\" rel=\"met\">Stuart<\/a> (which is good, one stuart langridge is more than enough...). The other thing about it I learned is that although some people may have a natural talent, the thing is that in my opinion most speakers have to work hard at making a great presentation. How eloquent you may be, if the message is not good, the presentation isn't.<\/p><p>Some of the smartest people I have met would never speak for a large audience, so it's up to the ones willing, to educate us. By realizing this I am lucky to see so many people in our field doing this so well, with so much <a href=\"http:\/\/nate.koechley.com\/blog\/\" rel=\"met\">energy<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/molly.com\/\" rel=\"met\">passion<\/a>.<\/p><p>So from here, I would thank all of the speakers that I have seen in the past and the ones I am going to in the future, for sharing so much of the knowledge and passion...<br \/>And off-course for entertaining us all!<\/p>",

With one exception and a major one at that, the input type = file. With that one every browser does what it wants, providing us as front enders with a challenge, as we have to satisfy the designers and so on.<\/p><p>A lot of the times we can get away with just accepting the fact that browsers are what they are, just whimsical annoying buggers. Sometimes a project calls for styling just the same, even on the file input. Just recently I came across such a project.<\/p><h3>The source<\/h3><p>Luckily we have giants to look at, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/quirksmode.org\" title=\"ppk\" rel=\"met friend\">the scariest hair in javascript<\/a>, who allready gave us a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quirksmode.org\/dom\/inputfile.html\">solution<\/a> and cautions us about using it.<\/p><p>That caution I share, so beware...<\/p><h3>Anyway<\/h3><p>But sometimes we have (or want) to take changes and do it anyway. So I wanted to implement the solution by ppk but in a <a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\">jQuery<\/a> fashion. Thus I wrote a plugin to  do what I wanted for jQuery, appropriately name inputfile.<\/p><p>Look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/demo\/inputfile\/\">demo<\/a> or just get the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnas.nl\/js\/plugins\/inputfile\/inputfile.js\">code<\/a>. And now for some explanation:<\/p><p>We start out by defining a new plug in like this.<\/p><pre><code>jQuery.fn.inputfile = function (){<br><br>}<\/code><\/pre><p>In this we first add a class to the input file we are going to fake, with this class we can hide it and put it over the fake file input. We than get the id and store it in a variable as we are going to need it later on.<\/p><pre><code>\tjQuery(this).addClass('hidden');<br>\tvar fii = jQuery(this).attr('id');<\/code><\/pre><p>So with the preliminaries  out of the way, we start building the fake stuff. What do we need, first an input type=text and a button, as those seem to appear in most file inputs and we are going to fake one, not define a new UI element.<\/p><pre><code>jQuery(this)<br>  .after('&#60;div class=\"fakefile\"&#62; >><br \/>  &#60;input type=\"text\" class=\"fakefile ' + fii + ' \" \/&#62; >><br \/>  &#60;span class=\"btn\"&#62;choose&#60;\/span&#62; >><br \/>  &#60;\/div&#62;');<\/code><\/pre><p>We than use css to position these element underneath the (nearly) hidden fileinput so that if the user clicks on the button he is in fact interacting with the fileinput. Now we need to let the input text reflect the changes made when something is uploaded and were done..<\/p><pre><code>\tjQuery(this).change(function () {<br>\t\tvar val = jQuery(this).val();<br>\t\tjQuery('.'+fii).val(val);<br>\t});<\/code><\/pre><p>And presto, we are done.To use the function you just need to include jQuery and the plugin in your page and call it like this:<\/p><pre><code>jQuery('foobar').inputfile();<\/code><\/pre><p>Have fun and use it wisely. I would love to hear from you when you use it, btw.<\/p>\r\n\t\t",

Web developers all over the world are throwing parties and stuff, but frankly I don't get it... IE6 is almost 8 years old now, if you can't code to that, I suggest you find yourself a proper job. And as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wait-till-i.com\/2009\/07\/14\/did-digg-and-youtube-just-spell-the-end-of-internet-explorer-6\/\">Christian<\/a> said:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Social web sites not supporting IE6 is a sign, but a sign to an audience that already understands the problem. It is like adding a message for blind users as a JPG without alternative text \u2013 nice idea, wrong tool to reach the intended target group.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>What I propose and am doing at my customers, is not to drop support for IE6 but simply demote it from <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/articles\/gbs\/#the-three-grades\">A-grade<\/a> support. So I created a 4th level of support for IE6, to be called A minus.<\/p><p>A minus support means, that everything still needs to work, but minor layout bugs get a lower priority. It means that you can use more advanced css stuff for the other A-grade browsers and accept that not everything will be supported in IE6. As long as it only is the rounded corners that those people are missing, that's fine with me.<\/p><p>And to my surprise also to a large number of my clients, especially after I explain to them the extra costs involved in making every little detail of a site the same across all browsers.<\/p><p>The added benefit of this is that you continue to support the legions of IE6 users, who <strong>can't<\/strong> upgrade their browser, due to company policy or what ever reason. They will never see the difference, as only us web developers test in multiple browsers. Real users don't even know ( in most cases ) that their is such a thing as a browser...<\/p><p>So dropping IE6 to A minus will let you do all of the css3 tricks you have been dying to do for years. IE6 users won't know the difference and better browsers will get a better experience. Your testers won't stop you from doing it, if you give them a different level that IE6 needs to go to...<\/p><p>See also <a href=\"http:\/\/maaike.tumblr.com\/post\/98125677\/ie6\">this<\/a> post from Maaike de Laat, as it seems she made this point earlier...<\/p>",

This is 'cause we all know that we need a catchy name for something to catch up...<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Part 1 - the HTML<\/em><\/p><h5>what is JITI and what is it to you?<\/h5><p>It stands for Just In Time Initialization and I first heard about it from PPK. He came in at one of my clients to review my javscript work there and he told me about some stuff he was working on.  JITI is a way to utilize the DOM as you API, something to speed up the loading and rendering time of your page. <\/p><p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/anwb.nl\/verkeer\">anwb.nl\/verkeer<\/a> I have started using it, in order to speed up the page. We used to render the images of for instance the rain radar as we loaded the page (anwb.nl\/verkeer ) and hide them with css. If you clicked on the appropriate checkbox we would set a css class on the body and show the image. This all seemed well and good, but a lot of people come to this page for just the traffic information and the traffic information alone. So why should we have them wait for the image they will never see...<\/p>\r\n<h5>JITI to the rescue.<\/h5><p>so now instead of loading the image before hand, we only load the location of the image, like this.<\/p><pre><code>&#60;li&#62;location\/of\/the\/image.gif&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>As we don't actually load the image, this results in no http request or data collected from the server, until we request the image to be shown by clicking the appropriate checkbox. We then let a small bit of javascript change that to:<\/p><pre><code>&#60;li&#62;\r\n  &#60;img scr=\"location\/of\/the\/image.gif\" alt=\"alttext\" \/&#62;\r\n&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre><h5>The point<\/h5><p>So why am I so excited about this? It simply means that we wont let the user wait for data he has not requested. He will not wait longer for a couple of features he may never use, only for what he wants to use. And by doing it by utilizing the dom as our api we don't burden the server with this, just the client and he asked for it...<\/p><p>We do a similar thing with the weather information, instead of rendering the html structure we need to show the weather stuff, we only render the data at page load.<\/p><p>so the user gets from the server this:<\/p><code><pre>&#60;li&#62;\r\n  &#60;span&#62;136,63,63,105&#60;\/span&#62;\r\n  &#60;div class=\"weerB\" title=\"licht bewolkt\"&#62;\r\n    licht bewolkt|18.0|zo|2|0.0\r\n  &#60;\/div&#62;\r\n&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p><em>Breaks added for clarity, the real thing is one big line of code, better yet the whole  html code is nearly devoid of white space or breaks.<\/em><\/p><p>after checking the box to see the weather we change that into:<\/p><code><pre>&#60;li \r\n  style=\"top: 136px; width: 63px; height: 63px; left: 105px; position: absolute;\"&#62;\r\n\t&#60;div class=\"weerB\" title=\"licht bewolkt\"&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;dl&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt&#62;licht bewolkt&#60;\/dt&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt\/&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt&#62;tekst&#60;\/dt&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dd&#62;18.0&#60;\/dd&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt&#62;temp&#60;\/dt&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dd&#62;zo&#60;\/dd&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt&#62;windrichting&#60;\/dt&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dd&#62;2&#60;\/dd&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dt&#62;windrichting&#60;\/dt&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;dd&#62;0.0&#60;\/dd&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;\/dl&#62;\r\n\t&#60;\/div&#62;\r\n&#60;\/li&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>\r\nSure, we could do all this with a couple of ajax calls, but with this solution we save the server a lot of calls ( this is a page that gets a couple of million visitors a month) and it's faster after the page has been downloaded. Yes the user still has to download a couple of bytes that may not be needed, but only minimal. If the extra data is a lot more, than a ajax call to fetch that data is viable in my opinion but you have to decide what to use on a case by case basis.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>I am wondering if I need a part 2 for the javascript, but I would like to hear your opinion on this<\/em><\/p>",

Apparently some (<del>make that lot<\/del>) people don't know one fundamental thing about inline and block-level elements.<\/p><p class=\"announce\">The fact is that you are not <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/struct\/global.html#h-7.5.3\">allowed<\/a> to nest them.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<p>This seems to be a small matter, but it has all sorts of consequences for the styling of the front end. What a lot of people don't get is that if you serve the browser invalid html, which is what you do if you nest a block-level element ( <code>div<\/code>) inside an inline element (<code>span<\/code>), you are at the mercy of it. A browser, and lets not name names, has a though job as it is when rendering <a href=\"http:\/\/validator.w3.org\">valid<\/a> html. What it is supposed to do with invalid code is anybody's guess.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<p id=\"code-ih\">So to test this I created a small <a href=\"files\/invalidhtml\/invalid.htm\">test page<\/a> with some invalid HTML and some simple CSS. What I did is that I nested a block-level element, in this case a div, inside an inline element, a span. Below that I swapped the div with the span. Both examples got a unordered list with one li.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<h4 id=\"code-html-ih\">HTML<\/h4>\r\n\t\t<pre><code>&#60;span class=\"foo\"&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;div&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;ul&#62;\r\n\t\t\t\t&#60;li&#62;list item&#60;\/li&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;\/ul&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;\/div&#62;\r\n\t&#60;\/span&#62;\r\n\r\n\t&#60;div class=\"foo\"&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;span&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;ul&#62;\r\n\t\t\t\t&#60;li class=\"\"&#62;list item&#60;\/li&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;\/ul&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;\/span&#62;\r\n\t&#60;\/div&#62;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\t\t<h4 id=\"code-css-ih\">CSS<\/h4>\r\n\t\t<p>I than gave it some simple css, which is below:<\/p>\r\n\t<pre><code>\tbody {\r\n\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\r\n\t\twidth: 40em;\r\n\t\tfont-size: 1.2em;\r\n\t\tfont-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\r\n\t}\r\n\t#test {\r\n\t\tborder: 4px dotted #ccc;\r\n\t\twidth: 200px;\r\n\t\theight: 200px;\r\n\t\tmargin-top: 5em;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.foo {\r\n\t\tborder: 1px solid red;\r\n\t\tpadding: 1em;\r\n\t\tposition: relative;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.foo div,\r\n\t.foo span {\r\n\t\tbackground: #dee2ee;\r\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 1em;\r\n\t\tpadding: 1em;\r\n\t}\r\n\tspan.foo li {\r\n\t\tbackground-color: #ccc;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.foo li {\r\n\t\tposition: absolute;\r\n\t\tleft: 100px;\r\n\t\ttop: 5px;\r\n\t}\r\n\tdiv.foo {\r\n\t\tborder-color: blue;\r\n\t}\r\n\t<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\t<h4 id=\"results-ih\">The results<\/h4>\r\n\t<p>The results where surprising, some browers tried to interpret the css and succeeded ( in a way ), while others failed in nice and surprising ways.

I know that proper front end developers will do this without thinking and I will agree that using stuff like WAI-ARIA tags will invalidate your code, but when you do that stuff I hope you know your basics. Stuff like this I see primarily in html rendered by some back end system put together by someone who <strong>doesn't<\/strong> know what they are doing. I will tell (and have told) you what you're doing, you're overly complicating the work of the front end developer.<\/p><p>I mean, we could work around these quirks, but why should we work to correct mistakes easily avoided? It would only mean adding extra lines of code to the css, thus making it harder to maintain...<\/p><p>My proposition is that we, as front end developers, simply refuse to work with invalid code. It is only a source of trouble and will cause more work which will cut into the budget and so on.<p>Now my question to you all, do you see this and\/or have any nice examples you would care to share in the comments or tell me about on <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wnas\" title=\"And YES, you should follow me, shameless plug.\">twitter<\/a> I would love to see them.<\/p>",

For various reasons, it blocks the rendering of your page, it is bad for maintenance and so on.<\/p><p>There is however, one notable exception to this rule. Sometimes it can be usefull to know if you have JavaScript enabled, so you can hide certain elements that depend on a user action. For instance, you have a login button that, when clicked, shows you a box for your username and password with a login button. You don't want to hide this with <abbr title=\"Cascading StyleSheets\">CSS<\/abbr>, so you would do that with javascript. Which you have put at the bottom of your html, just as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevesouders.com\/\" rel=\"met\">sir Souders<\/a> ordained. So at document ready the script kicks in and hides the right element. As this is not noticable on a fast site, sometimes the user can see a Flash of Unstyled Content.<\/p><p>So to countermand that, you can set a class on the <code><abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML<\/abbr><\/code> element to let the CSS know that it has to hide the correct stuff.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>&#60;script type=\"text\/javascript\"&#62;\r\n\tdocument.documentElement.className += ' js-on';\r\n&#60;\/script&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>With this in place you can write CSS to rely on the JavaScript and not have a Flash of  Unstyled Content.

A bug that let's you include css only for <del>chrome<\/del> <ins>WebKit<\/ins> browsers, like apple's safari and google's chrome. Look here for the <a href=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/files\/chromebug\/index.html\">example page.<\/a>, the text is red in <del>chromium<\/del> <ins>WebKit<\/ins> and black in other browsers. The HTML is valid in case you're wondering, so you won't catch it that way.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is to write a phony include that only <del>chromium<\/del> <ins>WebKit<\/ins> browser ( today ) will detect and act upon. Like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\n&lt;link type=\"<strong>custom\/mime+type<\/strong>\"<br \/>rel=\"stylesheet\" <br \/>href=\"css\/chromehack.css\" \/&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The type=\"<strong>custom\/mime+type<\/strong>\" is what does the magic. <del>Chromium<\/del> <ins>WebKit<\/ins> browsers will request the file from the server and add it to the document. What should happen is that browser shouldn't fetch the file or process it for that matter. The chrome team responded with a status: <strong>WontFix<\/strong>, which is wrong in my opinion. People will use this to write css to over come <em><del>chromium<\/del> <ins>WebKit<\/ins> bugs<\/em> instead of learning what it is they are doing wrong.<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning of the chromium team is:<\/p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/u\/jon@chromium.org\/\">\n<p>Darin, given the number of web sites this would likely break I don't think we want to be this strict.  If you disagree then I will re-open this.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I think that there is something to be said about this reasoning, but I am one of those people that wants browsers to be very, very strict... I understand that browsers don't want to \"break the web\", after all, who remembers the outrage that ensued when microsoft released version 7 of IE. A lot of people blamed IE for their own sloppy coding, breaking bad websites.<\/p>\n<h3>Why should this be fixed?<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of people write css to work around browser bugs, when they should go out and read the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/CSS2\/\">specifications<\/a>. Very often I see people complain about bugs, they have done something wrong in their <a href=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/invalid-html\">HTML<\/a>. So when I see a reaction like the wontfix by chromium I think that a lot of people still will take the <em>easy<\/em> way out and choose the hack, instead of learning to do it the right way. Not knowing that they are walking a fine line, utilizing a \"feature\" in a browser which may be fixed at any moment, thus rendering their <em>fixes<\/em> obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>So I hope that they will fix this soon, after all building browsers to allow sloppy coding is encouraging that very thing in my opinion. And yes, I know that the \"we render anything you code, even our own front page garbage\" is what made IE6 the greatest browser in it's time. But in the end it slowed down the web, as people were not encouraged to write proper code, but got away with building crap.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.getify.com\/\">Kyle<\/a> made an excellent point in his <a href=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/chromium-bug#comment-18947\">comment<\/a>. This is a <strong>WebKit<\/strong> bug or feature. The browser does not do anything wrong, as this is not being specified. So browsers can do what they want with it. He even makes some good points on how we could be using this. Still I am not conviced and urge people <strong>not<\/strong> to use this, as it will come back and bite you somewhere...<\/p>",

It adds nothing essential to the moviegoing experience. For some, it is an annoying distraction. For others, it creates nausea and headaches. It is driven largely to sell expensive projection equipment and add a $5 to $7.50 surcharge on already expensive movie tickets. Its image is noticeably darker than standard 2-D. It is unsuitable for grown-up films of any seriousness. It limits the freedom of directors to make films as they choose.

It seems like I am a real person too :). But this put a question in my head, what do most people do if you chain lots of things. All on one line, or each method on it's own line. Mind you, I compress my code when I go live, so size don't matter much, just readability.<\/p><p>So do you like:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\t$( 'foo' )\r\n\t\t\t\t.clone()\r\n\t\t\t\t.appendTo('#bar')\r\n\t\t\t\t.find('p')\r\n\t\t\t\t.removeClass( 'one' )\r\n\t\t\t\t.find('input, label')\r\n\t\t\t\t.val('')\r\n\t\t\t\t.removeClass( 'two' );\r\n<\/code><\/pre><p>Or do you like this one better:<\/p><pre><code>\r\n$( 'foo' ).clone().appendTo('#bar').find('p').removeClass( 'one' ).find('input, label').val('').removeClass( 'two' );\r\n<\/code><\/pre><p>Me I do both, in general I go for the one a method way when it's a lot of code and all on one line when it's only three or four things I am chaining. So, although I go for a consistent style in coding, I seem to violate my own principles when I review a project that I (like this one) work on for months. I wonder if this is something that can be prevented by setting strict coding guidelines or that we should accept it, as long as the overal principles are being followed.<\/p><p>After all, this is a project I worked on with several people, over a period of 6 months. In that time, deviations in coding style can occur, but when you follow the overall guidelines it does no harm in my opinion. The thing is that you should not make you coding standards to strict, as people tend to feel that they are in the way of their work, instead of helping them. Me, I am quit relaxed about coding styles, I tend to agree upon a certain naming convention and some common pattern and that is that. Formatting I can do from textmate, so other people's preferences don't bother me as I take over some code or do a review.<\/p><p>So we agree on a naming convention, like <strong>all-small-caps<\/strong> or maybe <strong>camelCasing<\/strong> or even <strong>using_underscores<\/strong>, and we then select for instance the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wait-till-i.com\/2007\/08\/22\/again-with-the-module-pattern-reveal-something-to-the-world\/\">Revealing Module Patter<\/a> and of we go...<\/p>\r\n<p>I am curious about your opinion on this. How do you people approach this when you do a big project or product? Do you work with more extensive guidelines or none at all...<\/p><p>I would really like to hear different opinions, as I think that this sort of thing is getting more important by the day...<\/p>\r\n<p><em>By the way, I wrote about <a href=\"http:\/\/wnas.nl\/css-coding-conventions\">CSS coding conventions<\/a> a long time ago...

                "content": "<p><strong>Problem<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I recently came across a small problem. When trying to get a movie (using the html5 video tag ofcourse) I found out that the iPhone doesn't play movies larger than  640 x 480 pixels and with a base profile other than H.264. Don't believe me, but look at <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/safari\/library\/documentation\/AppleApplications\/Reference\/SafariWebContent\/CreatingVideoforSafarioniPhone\/CreatingVideoforSafarioniPhone.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40006514-SW9\">their page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As the client really wanted his rather large movie on the page and did not wanted it to be scaled down a notch, I was presented with a challenge. He also really wanted it to work on his beloved iPhone... What is a guy to do?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After some time I came up with a solution and a rather simple one it is. I use the rather excellent <a id=\"html5media\" href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/etianen\/html5media\">html5media<\/a> script to get it to work in browsers without support for the video tag and want it to work in as many browsers as possible. So I already have two different sources in my video tag.<\/p>\n<p>Like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;video\n\tposter=\"pathto\/poster.png\"\n\twidth=\"780\"\n\theight=\"470\"\n\tcontrols\n\tpreload&gt;\n\t&lt;source\n\t\tsrc=\"pathto\/movie.ogv\"\n\t\ttype='video\/ogg; codecs=\"theora, vorbis\"'&gt;&lt;\/source&gt;\n\t&lt;source\n\t\tsrc=\"pathto\/movie.mp4\"\n\t\ttype='video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'&gt;&lt;\/source&gt;\n&lt;\/video&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>As the movie I tried to play was to big, the iPhone didn't wanted to play it. Turned out all I had to do was include a <strong>third<\/strong> source into the video tag, pointing to a iPhone specific file, like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;video\n  poster=\"pathto\/poster.png\"\n  width=\"780\"\n  height=\"470\"\n  controls\n  preload&gt;\n  &lt;source\n    src=\"pathto\/movie.ogv\"\n    type='video\/ogg; codecs=\"theora, vorbis\"'&gt;&lt;\/source&gt;\n  &lt;source\n    src=\"pathto\/movie.mp4\"\n    type='video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'&gt;&lt;\/source&gt;\n  &lt;source\n    <span style=\"color: red;\"> src=\"pathto\/movie.m4v\"<br \/><\/span>\n    type='video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'&gt;&lt;\/source&gt;\n&lt;\/video&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Here you go, a solution to play large video's on your website, without compromising the quality for the desktop and still get it to work on the iPhone...<\/p>\n<p>I hope this will help someone and if you have a better solution, please let me know...<\/p><strong>Links<\/strong><p>Some stuff I used to get the whole video she-bang working:<\/p><dl><dt><a href=\"http:\/\/camendesign.com\/code\/video_for_everybody\">camendesign<\/a><\/dt><dd>This got me started<\/dd><dt><a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/etianen\/html5media\">html5media<\/a><\/dt><dd>And this is what I use now to get it to work.<\/dd><\/dl>",

Having done some work on the HTML and CSS ones, I recently started with the javascript one. As I was working on it, I looked at the work done by others, like <a href=\"http:\/\/javascript.crockford.com\/code.html\">Douglas<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/theater\/video.php?v=crockonjs-3\">Crockford<\/a>. Some of my co-workers suggested that we did this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>var nameSpace = (function () {\r\n    \/\/ declare all of your var's before using them..\r\n\tvar config, init,x,doStuff;\r\n    config = {\r\n\t\ta : 'a'\r\n\t};\r\n\tinit = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\tdoStuff( arg );\r\n\t};\r\n\tx = '36';\r\n\tdoStuff = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\t\/\/ dostuff\ufeff\r\n\t};\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tinit:init\r\n\t};\r\n}());<\/code><\/p><\/pre>\r\n<p>While I initially agreed with this, as it seems nice and neat, I spotted a problem with it when it gets big. As you get a really big script and more people working on it, chances are that you will get someone to forget to declare a var in the beginning of the function, hence making it <strong>global<\/strong>.<br \/>Like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>var nameSpace = (function () {\r\n\t\/\/ declare all of your var's before using them..\r\n\tvar config, init,x,doStuff;\r\n\t<strong>\/\/ we forgot to add <em>doMoreStuff<\/em><\/strong><br>\r\n\tconfig = {\r\n\t\ta : 'a'\r\n\t};\r\n\tinit = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\tdoStuff( arg );\r\n\t};\r\n\tx = '36';\r\n\tdoStuff = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\t\/\/ dostuff\r\n\t\tdoMoreStuff();\r\n\t};\r\n\t<strong style=\"color: red;\">\/\/ doMoreStuff is <em>global<\/em><br>\r\n\tdoMoreStuff = function () {\r\n\t\talert( config.b );\r\n\t};<\/strong>\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tinit:init\r\n\t};\r\n}());<\/code><\/p><\/pre>\r\n<p>So I came up with a (not so revolutionary) way of avoiding this and I am curious what you think of it?<br \/>It goes like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>var nameSpace = (function () {\r\n\t\/\/ start with var to avoid global variables\r\n\tvar config = {\r\n\t\ta : 'a',\r\n\t\tb : 'b'\r\n\t},\r\n\t\/\/ continue with a comma to stay in the same var declaration.\r\n\t\tinit = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\tdoStuff( arg );\r\n\t},\r\n\t\tx = '3',\r\n\t\tdoStuff = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\t\/\/ dostuff\ufeff\r\n\t};\r\n\t\/\/ end with a semi colon.\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tinit:init\r\n\t};\r\n}());<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>I think that this has the advantage that when someone else continues with this code he can extend it easily, while not accidentally introducing globlal variables...<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>var nameSpace = (function () {\r\n\t\/\/ start with var to avoid global variables\r\n\tvar config = {\r\n\t\ta : 'a',\r\n\t\tb : 'b'\r\n\t},\r\n\t\/\/ continue with a comma to stay in the same var declaration.\r\n\t\tinit = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\tdoStuff( arg );\r\n\t},\r\n\t\tx = '3',\r\n\t\tdoStuff = function ( arg ) {\r\n\t\t\/\/ doStuff\r\n\t},\r\n\t<strong style=\"color: green;\">\/\/ if you add a new var it's not global<br>\r\n\t\tdoMoreStuff = function (){\r\n\t\t\/\/ do more stuff\r\n\t}<\/strong>;\r\n\t\/\/ end with a semi colon.\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tinit:init\r\n\t};\r\n}());<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>What do you think, is this a good way to structure your code or am I missing something?<\/p>",

Or you could fake the semantics by using classes and div's. So instead of using :<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>&#60;article&#62;Some content&#60\/article&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>You could use:<\/p><pre><code>&#60;div class=\"article\"&#62;Some content&#60\/div&#62;<\/code><\/pre><p>And have your cake and eat it too, as in: Support older browsers <strong>and<\/strong> use the proper semantics that html5 bring you. You could use this same technique for the various other html5 layout elements.<\/p><p>And maybe there comes a time that everybody supports html5 and you can than search and replace the various elements and finally be one of the cool kids.<\/section>",

                "content": "<p>Quite some time ago, we did some work on certification for <a href=\"http:\/\/fronteers.nl\/vereniging\/commissies\/diplomering\">fronteers<\/a>. Then it went dark, as all the volunteers, including myself, had too much other stuff to do. That is, until last autumn. During the last fronteers conference some members signed up as volunteers. As I have some time on my hands now we have decided to get things started again.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea is that we have is to do a two way exam. The first part will be a written exam on knowledge of HTML and CSS. In the second part the candidate will have to do some 'live coding', he\/she will be given a graphic design and they have to draw a possible solution on a white board. Explaining the choices made to two members of the certification committee (or other judges) as he\/she goes along.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the candidate successfully passes both tests, he\/she will receive two 'stars' on the certification for HTML and one for CSS. In the future we could expand the exams to include stars for JavaScript, performance, mobile, '<a href=\"http:\/\/versie2.webrichtlijnen.nl\/\">webrichtlijnen<\/a>', accessibility\u00a0and more. The first two stars are mandatory, as I think that any front end developer needs to have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.<\/p>\r\n<p>The stars are something a developer could put on their cv, site. Companies that employ them could use it to show the skills they have on board. The exams should be repeated every one or two years, as the field continues to change. Stuff that is relevant now could be plain obsolete in two years...<\/p>\r\n<p>Our big problem is now that we don't know if front end developers are interested in this certification.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some big companies are as well as dutch government agencies have expressed definite interest in this. For them it is a good way (they think) to find the right people to hire. Developers on the other hand are not that interested and I must say that I see their point. Other fields that have certification, like Java, made it clear to me that the best developers are not necessarily the certificated ones. Many front end developers are self taught and are not keen to study for something they have been doing for years, just for the sake of some certificate that may or may not be important.<\/p>\r\n<p data-twit=\"frontcert\">So here is my question to all of you developers out there, are you interested in certification. I even wanna know if you are not dutch or no members of fronteers, also clients may react. The easiest way to react is to tweet using the #hashtag #frontcert. All tweets containing this will be gathered below this article...<\/p><p><strong>UPDATE<\/strong><br \/>This article has created quite a buzz on the internet, something I had hoped for, but a lot bigger then I expected. A lot of people reacted strongly <strong>against<\/strong> certification, some with good points and all. The main consensus is that (experienced) developers are against, for a variety of reasons. This is what I expected and we (the whole committee) will take your opinions into account. I will write a follow up on this post shortly, to answer some questions and explain what wasn't clear in this post. I will also tell what we talked about in the committee the last week, as we are already thinking what to do with your reactions.<\/p><p>In the meanwhile, take a look at the reactions on the <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.fronteers.nl\/topic\/40\/commissie-diplomering\/\">fronteers forum<\/a> and read the <a href=\"http:\/\/martinkool.com\/post\/15718600033\/het-fronteers-certificaat-ajax-of-wc-eend\">article<\/a> by Martin Kool, who is strongly opposed. If you know of any other post about it, please let me know so that I can link to them.<\/p><p>And to you all, thanks for your opinions. Without those we (the committee) wouldn't know we had to do.<\/p>",

                "content": "<p>People I am a convert, I really am. After years and years with an iPhone I finally switched to a real one. Android I hear you say, pah. I mean windows phone 8 of course, the real deal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>os<\/h3>\r\n<p>And tell you what, it is not the thing for me. The os is something completely new, something that took more that a week to get used to and still has me guessing.<\/p><p>That it is new is a good thing, I love to see people try out different things. In fact one of the things I disliked about android is that it started out as a lesser copy of iOS. It has progressed now and has some things that iOS should have, but that took years. Windows phone at least starts fresh out of the box and that is a good thing.<\/p><p>Sad thing is that Nokia felt like they should add some things too. And those things don't exactly follow the windows guidelines.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Tiles and customising<\/h3>\r\n<p>The set up with tiles is nice and clean, what is also nice is that you can customise it with different colours. The colours, twenty in all, and if it's got a white or a black background is all of the customising you can do. Sure you can rearrange the tiles, make 'm smaller (only two sizes) and leave spaces between them, but a photo as a background, no sir, no can do.<\/p><p>If you set up a theme, as it's called, the notification bar at the top also changed to this colour. Sad thing it, it changes to an ugly shade of that colour.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Cons<\/h3>\r\n<ul><li><p>There were some things that I missed on this phone, which is a nokia 625. I can't control the volume of the sound with my headphone thingamajig, like I could with my iPhone. Android also won't let me do that. But maybe this is just my nokia and the samsung galaxy s2 that don't have this.<\/p><\/li><li><p>The UI is not consistent, there are windows apps, nokia apps and stuff I downloaded from the windows app store. And all of these things do different things with the back button for instance. Some take you back within the application, some back to the home screen, some do both at different points. I know that this is not a fault from windows, but I think that the apps should all follow the same UI guidelines and that that should be watched.<\/p><\/li><li><p>It's too big. It fits into my pocket, but only just. The screen has a decent resolution, but even I have trouble reaching everything with my big hands. (this is a phone thing, not a windows thing.)<\/p><\/li><\/ul>\r\n<h3>Pros<\/h3>\r\n<ul><li><p>It has the ability to extend it's memory with an sd card. So you can expand the memory easily and transfer your data to a different phone.<\/p><\/li><li><p>The battery is great, I have had times that I didn't need to charge it for two days. This is super for a modern phone.<\/p><\/li><li><p>The phone is way cheaper than an iPhone or a decent android phone.\r\n<li><p>You can pay for apps without a credit card, by adding it to your phone bill. This is a good thing I think, my payment details I won't give to everyone...\r\n<li><p>Internet Explorer 10 is a decent browser.\r\n<li><p>Nokia still knows how to build phones, it feels better to me than the average samsung phone, sturdier.\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>conclusion<\/h3><p>Folks, it looks like I'm no real convert, the ui glitches are the things that irk me the most.<\/p><p>That and the fact that I lived in an all apple universe for years and am used to the fact that my music, photos and all just appear on every device. I like it that the UI guidelines are followed more strictly, that apps work better and crash less often. These things bothered me too in my brief time on android phones, so maybe it's me.<\/p><p>But for now I will stay with it, as the fingerprint sensor of the iphone 5s has me wondering about privacy. And even if I give it up, to return to the apple universe, I picked up a decent windows phone for testing which surely is worth it's money...<\/p>",

                "content": "<p>Responsive web design is dead, long live Responsive web design. Or long live adaptive, reactive or pre emptive for all that I care web design.<\/p><p>We have been talking about Responsive web design for quite some years now. It has been the <a href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/responsive-web-design\/\">article<\/a> of Ethan Marcotte on Alistapart that got us all started and we have been selling it to clients for a long time now. I mean, four years is like ages in internet terms. But were we right to do so I ask.<\/p><h3>The question is, should we do RWD?<\/h3><p>If I got asked this question a year ago, I would have said yes, but nowadays I tend to disagree. The more I know about RWD, the more I think that the whole thing should be abolished.<\/p><p>Why do you ask; it is because I think that it is limiting us nowadays. It gets us focused on devices to which the product should respond to and makes us forget that the web IS flexible, we only forgot about it for so long that this whole RWD thing leads us to believe that we got something new. Something so new that only the most modern browsers or devices should get it.<\/p><p>We build sites that rely on JavaScript, often for no other reason than that we didn't think about it properly. Sites that require advanced JavaScript features just to show the content. We should be letting people use our content in their own way and not OUR way.<\/p><p>And when we don't get to do RWD, we point people to a number of app stores to get the App. Sometimes even on the desktop...<\/p><h3>What should we do?<\/h3><p>Now that is a surprisingly easy one to answer, just treat the web like the medium it is. An accessible, flexible and open medium, which can be enhanced and enriched in numerous ways, without leaving anybody behind.<\/p><p>If we adhere to the 'dao of web design' for instance, a fourteen (14!) year old <a href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/dao\">article<\/a> by John Allsopp, we should get along nicely today. If we go back and try to limit the amount of data served to the user initially like we used to do in the last century then maybe we could let go of the misconception that everybody has a good connection and a modern device and just give everybody a fast experience. Even those people in the train and in rural areas, we will help the ones on really fast connections even more. When we build stuff correctly, using standards for instance, we should leave no one behind while fully supporting all of the newer browsers.<\/p><p>Beware though, I am not saying that everybody should or could get the same experience. What I am saying is that everybody should get the same information in a way suitable for them. So if you build from the information (or content out), you could make something that not only works on yesterdays and todays devices, but maybe on tomorrows as well.<\/p><p>Tomorrows devices will come in more shapes and sizes than we can think of today, so being device agnostic will be even more important in a time when TV's and watches are not the weirdest devices we have to cater for. You only have to look at the variety of devices, browsers and operating systems we need to cater for in mobile alone today to imagine what kind of variety we will have when only wearables are coming of age. So please look back as well as forward, because the sites we made back in 1995 still work better now than the crazy DHTML ones we made after that. Not to mention the flashy ones...<\/p><p>So are you with me? I hope you are. No more RWD, just plain old Web Design from now on.<\/p>",

We have come a long way from the days of old, when starting a project consisted of the following steps:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Create a folder for the website, say foo.com<\/li>\r\n<li>in that folder create a file called index.html<\/li>\r\n<li>a css folder with style.css in it. <em>oke, for me this came later as there was no css in 1995<\/em><\/li>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was it.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nDone, no more steps. We just started writing markup and styling it with css (or inline font tags and such before css). Eventually we wanted to include some images and created a <em>img<\/em> directory for that. In some rare cases we needed JavaScript to create some mouseover events if things got really crazy, we may wanted a separate file for that but mostly we did that inline.<\/p> \r\n<p><strong>We wised up with the Javascript inline thing eventually, thankfully.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe whole folder got transferred to the the *foo.com website with a ftp tool and we where done.<\/p>\r\n<p>All we needed for skills to get this working were:<\/p>\r\n<ul><li>\r\n    basic html<\/li> \r\n<li>some css <\/li>\r\n<li>a bit of javascript. \r\n<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>That was it, end of story for the tech stuff. We still needed our other skills of course:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\nUser interface design basics\r\n    <\/li><li>graphical design basics<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Off to the pub, or add blink and marquee tags, whatever strikes your fancy. Life was simple back then.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Fast forward to today.<\/h3>\r\n<p>\r\nHow different our workflow looks today and how different the skill set we need to do the work. When we now start a project we go about it a bit different:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul><li>set up a github repo\r\n<\/li><li>choose a javascript framework\r\n<\/li><li>get it with *npm install*\r\n<\/li><li>learn the framework\r\n<\/li><li>choose another framework\r\n<\/li><li>write a prototype with said framework\r\n<\/li><li>based on that experience, change the framework again.\r\n<\/li><li>write javascript for gulp\r\n<\/li><li>change Gulp for webPack.\r\n<\/li><li>take a long time learning web pack\r\n<\/li><li>write javascript for node\r\n<\/li><li>write javascript to write html\r\n<\/li><li>write javascript to write css\r\n<\/li><li>write javascript to write javascript (es6)\r\n<\/li><li>publish to github using node and web pack.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>\r\nMost of what we do is writing JavaScript, a language so handy it is used for everything. And as they say, if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. So if you use JavaScript for everything, everything you need is JavaScript developers.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nAs this would seem very strange to the web developer of old, it is the case at many agencies and other places where people develop web sites. Most of the people working at these places are JavaScript developers, very good at some library and most likely ready to switch to another one.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nPure HTML or CSS developers are becoming a rare breed, looked upon by the JavaScript developers as not real developers.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nSkills you need now:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>JavaScript (vanilla but most likely the framework of the month)<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>\r\nHTML and CSS are an after thought or a necessary evil\u2026\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h3>Why is this bad (imho)<\/h3>\r\n<p>\r\nNot bad some might say, but what irks me is that these JavaScript developers are in some cases not real knowledgeable of the web and it\u2019s quirks. Sometimes they are former back end developers that treat JavaScript as just another platform and forget that it can fail and most probably will.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nHelped by the lack of information with clients, nowadays more and more projects are built in the fashion that JavaScript is working and that without it the site won\u2019t do anything. In most cases the people that are building it won\u2019t even consider the possibility of a non-JavaScript version.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nThese people are building a JavaScript web and lack even the knowledge of the plain web that the Flash developers of old had. They at least tried to cater to the html crowd in a way.\r\n<\/p><h3>Reasons<\/h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn my opinion this is bad for a number of reasons, for instance accessibility is hindered by this. I know that you can create an accessible website using loads of JavaScript, but the sad reality is that most people just don\u2019t care or don\u2019t know. Most of the champions of the users are not the back end developers turned JavaScript developer, but the HTML jockeys of old.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nAnother reason is speed, most of the time the framework is chosen to make the developers work faster, not to make the web site faster. This is however in my opinion the most important thing to do. Many back end developers never think about this or about the cost of their bytes in time and money. The average website is getting bigger and bigger and JavaScript is too blame for it almost as much as images are.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nMaintainability is another reason, frameworks come and go. I have heard more than one story about projects needing non existent developers for an old framework, one that is too entrenched in the software to be ever cheaply replaced. Vanilla Javascript does not have this drawback.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nThe user is the main reason, when choosing a JavaScript framework you never hear that this what the user wanted. The user simply wants a fast and pleasant site or application. Not a new framework or library.\r\n<\/p><h3>What can we do?<\/h3>\r\n<p>\r\nSpeak up and make your selves heard, tell people to embrace the web and the whole web. Don\u2019t put the JavaScript people down, get them aboard, we need them to create awesome stuff. Stuff that works for as many people as possible and excludes none.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nTell your clients that not only the hip and trendy are on the web but everybody, people with bad eyesight and even worse computers. People with fast connections and people without data plans and bad connections on their mobile.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nPlease stop and think before you start using frameworks, really most of the time you don\u2019t need them, you really are smarter than that. And if you doubt about using one, call me, I\u2019ll talk you out of it, I am here to help\u2026\r\n<\/p><p><em>Currently I am working on mobile applications written in NativeScript, Angular2 and typescript, so sorry...<\/em><\/p>\r\n",
