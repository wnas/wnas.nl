If you were wondering where I get my drive from. The drive to improve websites to use valid xhtml and css, to be nice to ALL browsers and stuff. Check out some of these major dutch sites...

<strong>Failed validation, 73 errors</strong>, what the heck is going on in the minds of the people that build this. Where have they been hiding for the past years...
In my opinion they are using an outdated cms, which has not been upgraded to spew out valid code. Why, because they didn't knew it mattered.

<strong>Failed validation, 234 errors</strong>...
Nothing I can say about this one, it doesn't even has a doctype!

<strong>Failed validation, 9 errors</strong>, a bit better but still, some interesting ones though. Clearly a case of the backend team thinking, standards, we don't need no frigging standards... Most of these errors can be cleaned up with minimum trouble, but I guess that no one really cared.

<strong>Failed validation, 21 errors</strong>
Would you trust these guys to come and work on your site, I don't think so...

<strong>Failed validation, 20 errors</strong> I am at a loss for words...

The real surprise is that if they confirmed to webstandards, they not only win in accesibility and less bandwidth consumption. But they also will save on development and maintenance costs. I would love to tell these people how they can improve their site and maybe will get the chance to do so...

<strong>Failed validation, 31 errors</strong> not good, my humble apologies to the world. We are working on it, we really are...
Check in a month or so... It will improve greatly...</em>
