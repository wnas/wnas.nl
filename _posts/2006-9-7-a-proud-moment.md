a few weeks ago I spotted a (minor) flaw in a great script and with the help of my esteemed co-worker Sander I figured it out. We put a <a title="the actual comment" href="http://www.robertnyman.com/2005/11/07/the-ultimate-getelementsbyclassname/#comment-6152">comment</a> on the site and to my suprise Robert Nyman himself took our advice to hart and incorporated it in his script. He even thanked us...
Now that is how you can make a javascript beginner proud :), I know that I make a big deal out of nothing. But you can understand that something like this is quite motivating to a guy like me... just beginning to understand javascript and all. I mean if something like this had happened on a css or xhtml topic, I would go like: he stupid, ask me for advice if you don't know it (but as polite as I can be) as I know my stuff in these fields. But for javascript, <strong>COOL...</strong>
