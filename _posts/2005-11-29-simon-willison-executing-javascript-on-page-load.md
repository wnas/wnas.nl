A must read, the comments alone make it worth reading. This is one for my archive of usefull js articles (actualy the first). As a co-worker of mine is leaving (bey Ard.) I have to learn javascript in a hurry. Luckily I allready know something but still, there is so much to learn..

If you are learnig too, come back and read the js posts as I am going to add quite a few in the next days.

(with this site being my own personal collection of links and code...)
