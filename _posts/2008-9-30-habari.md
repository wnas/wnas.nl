After a bumpy ride with my old wordpress blog, which has been up for more than 3 years and had collected all too much dust, I switched. For now the blog is running on <a href="http://habariproject.org/">Habari</a>, which looks really promising.

I tried textpattern, which I liked, but could not import my wp blog. So that went out, now it is time to work with the template, which is something which I will share with the habari community.

So if you have suggestions about what you want to see on the site or not, please let me know...

UPDATE
Comment spam is handled really well, not one got through so far (have i jinxed it now?).
