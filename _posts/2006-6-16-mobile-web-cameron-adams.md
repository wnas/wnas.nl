A nice talk with a conceptual look on mobile web. Do not first look at the technical stuff, but first look at why you will be going mobile. Put the user first and look at what he/she needs.

<strike>I will post a follow up on this...</strike>

The follow up:

<!--more-->It was nice but not very new to me, but then again I made my first wap game in 1999, so the mobile has been my playing field for some time now. And no, I have not tested this site mobile and have no intentions doing so, thank you very much.

Conclusion, I like his designs and his writing better than his presentation, sorry to say.
