<p>After long consideration, about 5 minutes that is, I booked for<a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/"> @media 2008</a>, I even got the super early bird discount. After being there for 3 times, including last November's @media ajax, I look forward to attending my 4th @media in a row.</p>
<a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/" title="@media2008' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/2234446940_0b4191c65e.jpg" alt="@media2008.png" border="0" width="269" height="75" /></a>
<p>It promises the same conflict the other two (normal) @media's had, two tracks presenting you with the choice which one you will follow. Often the two are equally interesting and offer something for everyone.</p>
<p>I do hope though that the presentations will be more challenging than last years, I had a blast but didn't learn all that much that summer. No offence to the fine people from <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/">vivabit</a> though, more a confirmation that I am on the right track maybe...</p>
<p>@media ajax was different though, a very focused two days which left me with my head spinning at times and not just from the beer. The presentations there varied from extremely challenging (<a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/speakers/#brendan">Brendan Eich</a>) to hilarious (<a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/speakers/#stuart">Stuart Langridge</a>).</p>
<p>Enough said, hope to see you all there, maybe for a few <a href="http://fronteers.nl/">Fronteers</a> beers....</p>
<p><em>Update, flight and hotel booked. more than 3 months in advance, a record for me...</em></p>
