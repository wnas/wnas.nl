<p>Last monday, I did my latest <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/wnas/frontend-workshop-presentation">workshop</a>. I spend almost 8 hours teaching a dozen or so java developers about the basics ( and then some ) of proper web development. Doing this is the most nerve wrecking piece of my work, as I am not quite confident about public speaking. But it also is one of the things I love doing most, as is talking about your passion is to most people, undoubtedly.</p><p><em>If you wake me up at 4 in the morning, gave me an espresso and asked me to explain some web stuff I will...</em></p><p>By doing these workshops I get even more respect for some of the great speakers I have seen and enjoyed over the years. Guys like <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/speakers/#jake" rel="met">Jake</a>, <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/speakers#stephen-hay" rel="met">Stephen</a>, <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/" rel="met">Chris</a> and many more. But it also gives me an insight about my own speaking capabilities.</p><p>One of my goals when I started as a freelancers again some 2 years ago, was to speak at a major conference. Something I succeeded in doing at the <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/speakers#wilfred-nas" rel="me">fronteers</a> conference, if only in a panel. Sitting at the other end of a presentation is a very different thing, that I can tell you.</p><p>One thing I learned is that speaking does not come easy, as I was very nervous. I can get a message across and tell a semi coherent tale, but I will never be a <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/" rel="met">Stuart</a> (which is good, one stuart langridge is more than enough...). The other thing about it I learned is that although some people may have a natural talent, the thing is that in my opinion most speakers have to work hard at making a great presentation. How eloquent you may be, if the message is not good, the presentation isn't.</p><p>Some of the smartest people I have met would never speak for a large audience, so it's up to the ones willing, to educate us. By realizing this I am lucky to see so many people in our field doing this so well, with so much <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/" rel="met">energy</a> and <a href="http://molly.com/" rel="met">passion</a>.</p><p>So from here, I would thank all of the speakers that I have seen in the past and the ones I am going to in the future, for sharing so much of the knowledge and passion...<br />And off-course for entertaining us all!</p>
