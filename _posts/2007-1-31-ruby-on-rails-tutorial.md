I just started tinkering with rail, thanks to some co-workers (yeah, guys really thanks, as if I had a social life...) who totally hate me. But I found the perfect starting point for me, right <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/" title="try ruby">here.</a> A simple but effective way to learn, by doing. I am sorry to say that the ui could be a little bit better and is unforgiving, but I am having a good time..
If you are into rails and starting just like me, go and check it out. If you are a ruby expert and know of some other sites like this one, let me know...
