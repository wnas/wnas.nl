<p>Sure, I have heard about font-smoothing and how not having it, really screws up your rendering. But hearing it and seeing it on your own xp installation is a different thing. I just saw this on my machine and I just had to share it with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Safari on OS-X has the best rendering in my opinion</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Rendering the default font, instead of just showing white is better in Firefox 3.5</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Even IE 7 does quite a decent job.</p>

<li>
<p>As allways, IE 6 screws up bigtime</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>But hey, screw IE6 I say. Not really, just go and check out this <a href="http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2009/11/29/how-to-detect-font-smoothing-using-javascript/">possible solution</a>. I am just now testing it and would like to know what you use or prefer..</p>
