<blockquote>
<p>The only way that I can see how responses like the one from the UK government can be prevented in the future is by shifting our focus:</p>
<ul><li>Instead of design prototypes and made-up web sites to show a certain technique let’s demand real production case studies and their effects (I remember one @media where the redesign of blogger was shown and how much traffic shifting to CSS saved the company – more of that, please).</li><li>Ask Microsoft to invite experts, host videos and tutorials of experts with modern solutions and distribute them on their network of clients</li><li>Make a massive comparison of government web sites and praise what some have done well (nothing works better than competitiveness)</li><li>Collect success stories of switching to open source solutions and how it saved money and time </li><li>Take a horrible IE6 only solution and show what it could look and work like if HTML5 and CSS3 were supported </li><li>Stop plotting shiny pixels on canvas elements and call it a cool HTML5 solution and instead build a complex online form or spreadsheet system using all of the goodies of HTML5 </li><li>Stop applauding people for redesigns of their blog and instead shift people into the limelight who made a difference in an environment like large financial systems or local government</li></ul>
