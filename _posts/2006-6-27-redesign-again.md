got some inspiration today, so I whipped up a new style. Let me know what you think of it... It has been tested (and looks ok, the same and stuff) in
<ul>
	<li>safari 2</li>
	<li>webkit (safari nightly build)</li>
	<li>firefox 1.5 (os x and win 2k)</li>
	<li>opera 9</li>
	<li>ie 5.2</li>
	<li>netscape 7.2</li>
	<li>camino 1.01</li>
	<li>ie 6.0 (win2k)</li>
</ul>
all on mac os x 10.4.6 and win 2k. So far looking good, <strike>I will be seeing it on a windows machine tommorow morning, looking forward to it.</strike> also on windows 2000 with both ie6 and firefox 1.5. The links in the header don't have the right border at the bottom in ie, but I will fix that eventually.. (update - nope, don't want to fix that...)
