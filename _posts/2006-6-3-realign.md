thanks to cameron moll's great article on his design of <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000905.html">The national gazette</a> I came up with some tweaks. I wasn't so happy with the overall design.

<!--more-->And I am still not quite satisfied, but give me a few weeks and I will have it.. The years of not designing and just coding are taking its toll. A few years ago I would have had more ideas than I knew how to code, no it is the other way around...

The things bugging me now are the content on the main page and the distribution of it on the content pages (the ones like this one) I feel that I need to reserve more room for the articles on these pages that I have now, but I do not know where I am going to put the other content here. I think that a content width of around 600px to the left will be all right, but I am having doubt what the rest will be like.

Bear with me and post a comment about any errors that you might see in some obscure browsers I will not test (ie 6 is one of them :) ). And if you have any ideas about the design, just let me know. I am working on a contact page somewhere, so in the future you can drop me a line...
