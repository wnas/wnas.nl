Now this is an interesting read, how are you going to design a user interface for the One Laptop Per Child. This has got to be a challenge and I am definitly going to read <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines">this</a>.

Imagine the problems, you encounter as you have to design a interface for such a broad audience. And for such a challenging platform, no fast video cards and lots of ram.

The constraints have a lot of parallels with my particular line of work. Designing user interfaces for web applications running in a citrix enviroment, also can be challenging. We want to use the latest ajax tools, but are hampered by constraints. Our audience is bound to a miserable browsing platform (ie) and lousy preformance.

Still within constraints the best things are being created, so I will learn from "sugar" as the UI is being called.
