Google has brought back their search index of 2001, as Dan Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/10/01/google-search-2001">mentioned</a>, without things like <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=wilfred+nas&hl=en&sa=N&btnG=Search">this</a> site and the iPod. With <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=alistapart&btnG=Search">alistapart</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=zeldman&btnG=Search">zeldman</a> of course , as those were the resources I turned to in those days together with <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=webmonkey&hl=en&sa=N&btnG=Search">web monkey</a>. 

But what is more important to us web developers, without <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=quirksmode&btnG=Search">quirksmode</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=firebug&btnG=Search">firebug</a> (as a plugin that is), a plugin of an non-existent <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=firefox&btnG=Search">browser</a>. A lot of the stuff that we depend on to do our work were not even there in the year my oldest son was born. 

To me that is weird and makes me wonder if the digital world we life in today has any real substance, as it all is so temporarily.

I wonder what other professions will be looking for and not finding? 
Is ours the only field that changes so rapidly, or is that only our perception?
