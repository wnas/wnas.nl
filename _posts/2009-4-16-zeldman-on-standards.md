<p>This is one to <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/04/08/what-are-web-standards/">see</a>.</p><p>A great interview with jeffrey zeldman about web standards. He talks about his view on them and how the adoption came around. A nice piece is around the 6th minute, where he explains why he started doing standards. Turns out he had the same reason I did, he just didn't want to build 4 versions of each page but wanted to focus on the content and the design.</p><p>So In other words, if you use web standards you get to go to the pub earlier :.</p>
