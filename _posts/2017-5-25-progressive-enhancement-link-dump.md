<p>One thing that is strange about this whole subject is that you can find people writing about it 10 years ago or even longer. Nobody is saying much new in general principle and still it is not being done a whole lot, this PE thing. As I will try to teach people, with PE nobody gets left behind, you can have your cake and eat it too. Maybe some day we will all try and make the web for everyone again...</p>
