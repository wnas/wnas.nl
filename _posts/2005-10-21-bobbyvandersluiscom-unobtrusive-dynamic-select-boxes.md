<a href="http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/articles/unobtrusivedynamicselect.php">bobbyvandersluis.com | Unobtrusive dynamic select boxes</a>

this is one example I am going to use, although I think it is not correct use of css. Normally I am all for  correct semantic code, but using css to influence behaviour is allowed if it works well for the user.

And in this example it works, dynamic dropdown boxes without a reload. Allthough it could be done in ajax probally...
