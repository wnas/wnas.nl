<p>welcome to part 2 of the new series, how to redesign a site with less code, keeping structure, behaviour and presentation strictly seperate. First we will start with a clean xhtml 1.0 document, like the one beneath the fold...<!--more--></p>
<p class="code">< !DOCTYPE html<br />
PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"<br />
"DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"><br />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" /><meta content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type" /><br />
This way, we let browsers know how we want our code to be interpreted. Look doctype up with google and see what you can find...</p>
<p>Come on you, go and look it up, I'll wait...</p>
<p>Back allready, good. We will move on, now that you know what doctypes are and what they do, we'll set up the rest of the document.</p>
