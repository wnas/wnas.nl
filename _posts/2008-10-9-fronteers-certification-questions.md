I am very happy to say that the answers keep coming in from <a href="http://wnas.nl/fronteers/">the fronteers</a> test I  put online some time ago. Thank you all!

I will take some time this weekend to sift and judge through all off them and will put up a new version later this week!

If anyone has any new questions or ideas, please let me know.
