As two co-workers are going to give a guest college at a dutch college about Ajax, they asked me for some links. I thought it might be a good idea to share those with the world. So, here ya go, some links in no particular order...<!--more-->

<dd>I don't know much about this one, other than what I read about it. It seems to write your javascript, which I consider wrong.
You should allways know what you are doing.</dd>

<dd>Very cool demo's, very messy code and closed source. So in my opinion a no go.</dd>

My personal favorite is a small but smart library. It also has great documentation and lots of plug ins...<br />
jQuery is a fast, concise, JavaScript Library that simplifies how you traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and add Ajax interactions to your web pages. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.

<dt><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a></dt><dd>
Dojo is an Open Source DHTML toolkit written in JavaScript. It builds on several contributed code bases (nWidgets, Burstlib, f(m)), which is why we refer to it sometimes as a "unified" toolkit. Dojo aims to solve some long-standing historical problems with DHTML which prevented mass adoption of dynamic web application development.

<dt><a href="http://mochikit.com/">Mochikit</a></dt><dd>
MochiKit is a highly documented and well tested, suite of JavaScript libraries that will help you get shit done, fast. We took all the good ideas we could find from our Python, Objective-C, etc. experience and adapted it to the crazy world of JavaScript.

<dt><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a></dt><dd>
Prototype is a JavaScript Framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications.<br />
Featuring a unique, easy-to-use toolkit for class-driven development and the nicest Ajax library around, Prototype is quickly becoming the codebase of choice for web application developers everywhere.

The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX. The YUI Library also includes several core CSS resources.
