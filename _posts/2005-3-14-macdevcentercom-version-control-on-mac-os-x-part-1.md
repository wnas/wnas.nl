This is for all of you out there, who as I am, are halfway there. I work with eclipse, building Java and JSP. But I will not get my work wasted, so I am installing a cvs.

But, to tell the truth, in my work I usualy have someone setting up my work enviroment for me, and (lazy as I am) I am quite happy with that. Now has come the time for me to get my hands dirty and do some work myself. Good luck to me...
