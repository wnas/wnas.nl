<p>As I am to busy to concentrate on some real writing on stuff that I am working on, such as jQeury plugins, adobe air and stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/05/01/css-float-theory-things-you-should-know/">a good float article</a>, as it can't be explained enough</li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualhosting.com/blog/2008/microformats-university-100-articles-and-resources/">a nice and long list on microformats</a>, as a reference.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery_plugin/">jQuery plugin developement by snook</a>, he is the man.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern">jQuery plugin patterns</a>, usefull.</li>
<li><a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/article/103/jQuery-Plugin-Actions-vs-Utilities">More jQuery plugins</a>, also.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/ajax/articles/air_ajax_developers_03.html">Air for ajax developers</a>, that is for me.</li><li><a href="http://www.snook.ca/archives/adobe_air/snoto_photo/">Air by snook</a>, a nice demo app with source code.</li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=air%20tutorials&sourceid=mozilla2&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Air by google</a>, search results..</li><li><a href="http://onair.adobe.com/schedule/cities/amsterdam.php">Air in Amsterdam,</a> I will be there, will you?</li></ul>
<p>I will try to make some time to write some good stuff, as the things I am working on are quite nice (oo javascript anyone?), but first I have two real world deadlines this month. Both on the same day, so I will have to do with less sleep the coming three weeks.</p><p>On the other hand, I will be going to adobe onair in amsterdam this friday and a nice short vacation beginning of may sure looks possible. So all things considered, stuff are looking good, deadlines and all considered. After all, if I didn't like deadlines I should not be working on the web, right?</p>
