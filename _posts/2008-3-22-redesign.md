<li>Tweaking the css for almost a day now, got it asides from some usability issues. The logo (which is the a inside the h1) is clickable, but I got a h2 with the blog name not a link. In order to solve that I gotta throw a lot around in the php. Not used to dabbling in php anymore, so step lively now...</li>
<li>Now for a break, will look at the icons and javascript after this, in no particular order... Site is now build using only two images (besides the ones in the articles), no javascript so just POSH..</li>
</ol>
