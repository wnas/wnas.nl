This is a must read article for any serious webdeveloper. It can help you explain the standards case to your managers and or clients. I have used it a couple of times now to convice people of the importance of good use of standard (x)html and css in various projects...<br />
It helps you in giving a real life example, with the most important argument. That is SAVES MONEY in the long run at least is my not so humble opinion.
