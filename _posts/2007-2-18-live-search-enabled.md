After several months of not having any search on my site, I decided to add it again. Frankly, I missed it myself, as I use this site as an archive for stuff that I need.<br />
So I did some googling and came up :</p>
<p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.cneophytou.com/2006/03/26/livesearch/"><a href="http://www.cneophytou.com/2006/03/26/livesearch/">Voodoo Programming Â» Blog Â» LiveSearch</a></cite></p>
<p>
I may want to go through the code of the plugin as it has a lot of inline javascript, but for now, it is working...</p>
