<p><em>As we did in 2007, A List Apart and you teamed up to shed light on precisely who creates websites. Where do we live? What kind of work do we do? What are our job titles? How well or how poorly are we paid? How satisfied are we, and where do we see ourselves going?</em></p><p>Great survey, with the results marked up in an extra ordinary manner by Eric Meyer. The data is presented in a series of tables as plain data and than styled masterfully with css.</p><pre><code>&#60;tr&#62;<br />	&#60;th scope="row"&#62;Definitely not&#60;/th&#62;<br />	&#60;td&#62;<br />		&#60;div&#62;<br />			&#60;p style="width: 27%;"&#62;<br />				&#60;span&#62;27.0%&#60;/span&#62;<br />			&#60;/p&#62;<br />		&#60;/div&#62;<br />	&#60;/td&#62;<br />&#60;/tr&#62;</code></pre><p>This very simple table looks like this, after some css.</p>
