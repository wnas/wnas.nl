On <a title="everything you want to know about ajax" href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">ajaxian</a> I found this great Article about the <strong>A</strong> in ajax.

Go and look up <a title="doing-it-asynchronously a must read" href="http://jeffreysambells.com/posts/2006/12/13/doing-it-asynchronously/">doing-it-asynchronously</a> it explains the concept with examples and a very clear text. This is one I will keep around to refer people to as I am explaining (once again) why you should use ajax and what it is all about.
