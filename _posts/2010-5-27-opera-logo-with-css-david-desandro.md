<p>This article inspired me to do my own logo with <a href="http://wnas.nl/wnas-logo-in-css3">border radius</a> and <a href="http://wnas.nl/wnas-logo-in-data-url">data url's</a>. I didn't read it at the time and just went ahead. Now I see that the logo looks <strong>great</strong>, really good job and a great explanation too. Looks like mine is not that clear :).</p>
