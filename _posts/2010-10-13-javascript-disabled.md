<p><img style="float: right; margin-right: -100px;" title="Zakas_3244_bigger.jpg" src="http://wnas.nl/user/files/zakas_3244_bigger_20101013071448.jpg" border="0" alt="nicholas zakas" width="73" height="73" />I just came across a small article by <a href="http://twitter.com/@slicknet">Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet)</a>, who I saw give a great presentation at last fronteers conference by the way, in which he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While the percentage of visitors with JavaScript disabled seems like a low number, keep in mind that small percentages of big numbers are also big numbers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Via <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled/">YDN Blog</a>.)</p>
<p>Please remember that the same thing goes for visitors who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using IE6</li>
<li>a screen reader.</li>
<li>a mobile phone</li>
<li>a non iphone phone, like symbian</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
