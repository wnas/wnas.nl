As a result of dishing out the same links over and over again, I decided to update my <a href="http://www.wnas.nl/?page_id=30">Web development links page</a>.<strike> The page now allows comments, so any suggestions are welcome...</strike>

The good thing about me spreading the same links over and over is that web standards are coming into focus in my workplace.

So after 3 year fighting windmills, I am finally getting some help :)
