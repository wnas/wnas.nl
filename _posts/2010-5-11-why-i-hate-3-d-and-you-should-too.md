My take on 3-D movies, I get a headache. And to be honest, that's not what I'm looking for when going to a movie, don't know about you though... The one movie I have seen in 3-D, UP, was great.
But it was great when I watched it at home on dvd, in movies also: *content is king*. 3-D is the same as the web2.3462 gradients, a fad. Or at least I hope...

*Roger Ebert*
>"3-D is a waste of a perfectly good dimension. Hollywood's current crazy stampede toward it is suicidal. It adds nothing essential to the moviegoing experience. For some, it is an annoying distraction. For others, it creates nausea and headaches. It is driven largely to sell expensive projection equipment and add a $5 to $7.50 surcharge on already expensive movie tickets. Its image is noticeably darker than standard 2-D. It is unsuitable for grown-up films of any seriousness. It limits the freedom of directors to make films as they choose. For moviegoers in the PG-13 and R ranges, it only rarely provides an experience worth paying a premium for."</p>
