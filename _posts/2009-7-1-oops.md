<p>Due to some problem with a faulty table that habari set in my mysql database and/or the inability of my host (who has some problems) to create backups from it, all of my content from last october untill now was lost. I am now slowly returning everything, but for the comments as google doesn't cache them as it does my page.</p><p>So it will be bumpy and I will be making more frequent backups from now on, I promise, I really will. As for the comments, I will do my best and if anyone has a suggestion, please do...
