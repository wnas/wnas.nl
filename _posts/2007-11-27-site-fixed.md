<p>After a bumpy ride, my move from host to host is fixed. Since my new host does not run on apache but instead on IIS, I had some starting problems. That is putting it mildly, none of the links worked, but all of that is after us now.</p><p>All I have to do now is fix the 404 page, as it is going to be in heavy use, until google updates its links. IIS does not have mod_rewrite, so my previous friendly url's are out of the question, sorry for that.</p><p>I expect some trouble in the days ahead, so if you spot anything, please let me know...</p>
<h3>Update bookmarks</h3>
<p>Just one thing, as my mod_rewrite doesn't work, bookmarks don't work...</p>
