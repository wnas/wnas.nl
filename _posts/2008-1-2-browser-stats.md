<p>Today I read a lot on the web and also some statistics, some for next year, some of the past. One of the sites that I came across was <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2">marketshare</a>, where they had a nice infographic.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57462165@N00/2158724863" title="View 'browserStats2007.png' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2182/2158724863_8cb230253d.jpg" alt="browserStats2007.png" border="0" width="500" /></a>
<p>One thing I do wonder about, how much of IE's share is actually Opera or Safari posing as IE. Does anybody knows if this sort of thing can be measured. One of the things I know that people do when testing for browsers is using <strong>document.all</strong> thinking that only IE reads that, update Opera does too.</p><p>The good thing about reading this was that finally IE6 is losing marketshare, as you can see in the next one. So to start of with a good thing in 2008, IE6 will eventually dissappear...</p>
