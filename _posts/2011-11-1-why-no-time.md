<p>Recently there was decided that we don't need a <code>&#60;time&#62;</code> element in html5 and it was replaced the utterly not semantical <code>&#60;data&#62;</code> element. I hurried to change my sites code, even if I <strong>DON'T</STRONG> agree. Rather than write something about it myself, I'll let the ever so polite <a href="http://twitter.com/brucel">mr Bruce Lawson</a> have a go at it.

<p><strong><code>&#60;data&#62;</code> is too vague, too bland, it sucks.</strong></p>
