<p><img style="float: right; margin-right: -50px;" title="whatsnew_featurenav_reader_20100607.jpg" src="http://wnas.nl/user/files/whatsnew_featurenav_reader_20100607_20100629093736.jpg" border="0" alt="safari_reader.jpg" width="127" height="68" />Cool and long overdue. The sites that make me visit multiple pages for one article only make me use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader">reader</a> functionality of safari.</p><p><em>And get annoyed...</em></p>

<p>"Think of how a typical user session works on most news sites these days. A user loads an article (1 pageview), pops open a slideshow (1 pageview), flips through 30 slides of an HTML-based slideshow (30 pageviews). That’s 32 pageviews and a lot of extraneous downloading and page refreshing.</p>
<p>On new msnbc.com story pages, the above sequence would register one pageview: the initial one. The rest of the interactions occur within the page itself. Can msnbc.com serve ad impressions against in-page interactions? Sure, and that’s key to the strategy, but as a user, your experience is much smoother, and as an advertiser, the impressions you purchase are almost guaranteed to come across human eyes since your ads are only loaded upon user interaction."</p>
