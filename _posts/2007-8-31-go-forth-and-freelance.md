Today (september 1st 2007) I have taken (once again) a step into the world as a freelance user interface specialist. After more than 3 years of working with <a href="http://www.lucka.nl/" title="lucka consultancy">lucka,</a> which is a new record for me, I have decided to go at it alone. The years at lucka have been nice, but I think it the time to start my own business again.

Why do you ask, well let me tell you

<em>I woke up one morning and it just came to me, from a big light in the sky: </em>

<em><strong>"GO FORTH AND FREELANCE"</strong></em>

<em>And so I did offcourse, as everybody knows, there is no ignoring big lights in the sky. Bigger men than me (and those have to big, as I am 192cm) have tried and failed. So forth I went, to take the freelance path... </em>

Just kidding folks, in the past 15 years I have been working independently more than I have been employed. After due consideration I decided that it was time to do it again. In the past I have had good and bad times as a freelancer, but the good was more present than the bad. So I have more than enough expierence in working freelance, to see it's advantages en it's disadvantages. In the end it was the freedom to be my own boss that did it, as I always have been an independent fellow.

My experience also has grown that I am confident enough to take on the challenge, after all I do have more than 10 years of expierence in web work. I started out as a graphic designer bitching about developers to finally become the developer that I started out bitching about. During that time I have learned a thing or two about both the technical and user side of web design, worked for a large number of clients and done quite a couple of nice things.

I plan on doing more of less the same work, providing clients with excellent user interface development and design. Further more I am still working on other things to do. I want to teach, I want to write more, launch a product or two, pick up painting again, maybe do some coaching and what more...

But the most important thing that I plan to do is spend more time with my family and have fun and challenging projects to work on.

So if you have some work for me, don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.wnas.nl/?page_id=305" title="contact page">contact</a> me...
