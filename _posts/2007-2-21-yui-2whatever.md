Yahoo has released a new version of their YUI framework, and it looks very promising. To be honest, I still haven't looked into it enough. So my opinion still stays the same, I think it is too big and too much.
If I need something to pick up the pizza, I will write it myself. And I will not force my users to download something that they (or I) <em>may</em> need someday. But still, it is very cool scripting being done. And their support plan, with different grades and all is something that we all should be implementing.

For me, I will stay with plain domscripting and jquery (the latter if I am lazy), so I will understand what I am writing and hopefully will be able to debug it. Because, to my knowledge, murphy's law still works...

Enough said, go <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/02/20/yui-220-released/" title="YUI">there</a> and check it out for your self. If you work with it, please enlighten me and tell me what you think...
