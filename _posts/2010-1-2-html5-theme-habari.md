<p>Right now I am working on a redesign of this site. Since I believe in open communication, I will be doing this redesign live. So no testing behind closed doors and so on. 
</p>
<p>I will be doing this live for all to see.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think.. <br />
( and yes the theme will be made public... )</p>

<strong>Update</strong><p>strange, Habari just reverted to the default theme overnight, this is why I am back to k2...</p>

<strong>Update 2</strong>
<p>Happily hacking away at some css, while trying to set up a proper html5 structure. This is very interesting as it is a break from the old div's with id's and classes. That I got covered, now I am in new territory. Wish me luck...</p>
